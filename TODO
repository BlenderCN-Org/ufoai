TODO list for UFO: Alien Invasion
=================================================

This file lists tasks that needs to be done so we can release the next version of the game. This includes "blocking" bugs, uncompleted/missing features and the like.
Finished tasks should not be deleted, but marked with "[DONE]".

This list is not meant to replace the bug-tracker
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=157793&atid=805242
and feature-tracker
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=157793&atid=805245
it's more of a roadmap.


=================================================
Tasks for future releases

* [Hoehrer] Pre- and post-research descriptions.
* Some kinda "target-list" for the geoscape that lists all the available ufos/locations in a nice list and let you select them in the map.
** This is related to FR #1489070: Make missions appear a minimum distance from a base.
** Additional to the global list a 'per-click list' would be cool. e.g.: If multiple targets are in the same spot popup a list with only these entries.
* [Hoehrer] Add an event system (id/message+type/year+day are defined) and integrate it into the research-system, the current messag esystem and the ufopedia ("news").
* FR #1493721: Change of building-selection (building info)

=================================================
Tasks for TechDemo3

* Fix "Intro" and "Prolog" text in all languages (translations needed).
* Finish the english language file
* Put some work into campaign.ufo - place yet unused missions to geoscape and integrate them into campaign.
* Bugs that need to be checked (reproduceable/fixed):
** Bug #1459713: Armored soldiers appear as purple diamonds
** Bug #1461639: Soldier equipment vanishes on mission retry
** Bug #1459259: there is no reaction fire?
** Bug #1443163: Reaction fire fires at all guys around
* Implement flying UFOs and their interception. If this is not finished it'll be moved to the TODO-list of next release.
* Check and balance the new weapons (grenade launcher, stunrod, etc..)
** Stunrod is not displayed correctly and is to big.
** [DONE] Laser weapons should not be buyable (they are researched by Phalanx) DAMN we need to leave them in, because we can't "produce" yet.

* [DONE] Bug #1474623: Bug in savegame: aircraft problems
* [DONE] Bug #1482877: map b/g/ufo_hangar.map does not compile
* [DONE] Bug #1444732: game exits with error (crash: probably a string-handling error in combination with gettext)
* [DONE] Make unresearched items in the Ufopedia invisible.
