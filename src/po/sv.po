"Det är med mycket stor stolthet jag rapporterar att vårt projekt har varit framgångsrikt. Jag har inkluderat bilder på vårat prototyplaservapen som åstadkommer kontinuerlig vågformsutgång och ändå är litet nog att bära med sig för en enskild person.\n"
"\n"
"Den praktiska lösningen låg inte i lönlösa försök att tillverka större batterier, utan i stället använde vi radikala miniatyriseringstekniker för att kunna göra existerande kemiskt drivna laserkomponenter mindre och lättare. Kemisk laser har använts länge, och har funnits i experimentella vapenprogram sedan slutet av 1900-talet, men tekniken har alltid lidit av många problem. De enda typer av kemisk laser där militära tillämpningar har varit aktuella har varit alldeles för stora och klumpiga för att infanterister ska kunna bära med sig dem i strid. Fram tills nu har lasertillämpningar i strid varit begränsade till laserkanoner monterade på stridsvagnar eller missilvärnsbatterier på fartyg.\n"
"\n"
"Nu har vi inom PHALANX byggt en miniatyr av en konventionell laserkanon. Trots dess ringa storlek är den fullt kapabel att hantera deuteriumflouridreaktionen och det giftiga avfallet utan risk för förorening. Låt mig kort beskriva hur det fungerar.\n"
"\n"
"Inuti förbränningskammeren förbränns eten i kvävetrifluorid. Reaktionen producerar exciterade fluorinradikaler, som sedan förs in i en blandning av helium- och deuteriumgas. Deuteriumet reagerar med fluorinet och producerar exciterad molekyler av deuteriumfluorid. Molekylerna utsätts sedan för stimulerad emission i vapnets optiska resonator, och där genereras strålen. En rad intelligenta linser fokuserar och riktar strålen dit användaren siktar och korrigerar dessutom för mindre rörelser hos användaren eller målet. Avgaserna av deuterium körs genom vårt specialbyggda högtrycksfilter, som fångar upp alla giftiga och radioaktiva molekyler innan den kvarvarande ofarliga ångan släpps tillbaka ut i atmosfären.\n"
"\n"
"Filtret måste bytas ut efter varje uppdrag, men vi har designat systemet för att det ska vara lätt och smärtfritt. Om filtersystemet på något sätt skadas under ett uppdrag, kommer vapnet omedelbart att sluta fungera för att förhindra förorening.\n"
"\n"
"Lasern använder infraröda våglängder, så den ger ingen synlig stråle förutom för dem som bär IR-glasögon.\n"
"\n"
"Tyvärr är prototypen som vi har konstruerat inte redo för fullskalig produktion som infanterivapen än. Mer förfining och balansering behövs innan den kan användas av människor, men uppfinningarna som vi har gjort kan också användas för fordonsmonterade vapen -- kanske till och med på flygande fordon. Jag har skickat Er ett flertal nya förslag på huvudidéerna som vi har tagit fram.\n"

"Vårt samlade forskningsarkiv från FN har gett oss en stor mängd värdefull information om den vapenutveckling som har gjorts i världen sedan sekelskiftet. Ett av de mer intressanta ämnena har varit produktionen av DEW (Directed Energy Weapons, eller riktade energivapen), det vill säga vapen som överför energi till ett mål på andra sätt än via en projektil. Vi är i synnerhet intresserade av filerna som behandlar kontinuerlig våglaser.\n"
"\n"
"Många länder och företag har genom åren försökt att skapa lasrar som är kraftiga nog att användas som vapen, men ingen har kunnat bygga en laser som går att bära med sig och som ger tillräckligt med energi för att kunna jämföra sig med ordinära eldvapen. Nu har vi emellertid fått tillgång till all samlad laserforskning, och även hela bibliotek fyllda med jordens mest avancerade teknologi. Jag anser att vi inte bara kan tillverka ett effektivt bärbart laservapen, utan även bygga det i storlekar som aldrig tidigare setts när det gäller DEW.\n"
"\n"
"Vi bör forska i det här området så snart som möjligt. Att variera vår arsenal kommer att göra den mycket svårare att försvara sig emot, och våra erfarenheter kan möjliggöra för oss att utveckla flyglaservapen effektivare än konventionella vapen kan användas mot UFO: n med hög hastighet .\n"

"The first artificially produced antimatter on Earth consisted of 9 atoms of anti-hydrogen created at the CERN particle physics laboratory, situated near Geneva on the border between France and Switzerland.

We've come slowly forward over the years in tiny, tiny steps, but even though we can now produce antiprotons by the millions, it's easy to forget just how little that really is.\n"
"\n"
"In fact, the biggest obstacle to our adaptation of the alien fuel is the availability of antiprotons. We've come a long way since 1995, but even with every particle physics laboratory in the world churning out as many antiprotons as possible, it would take eighty million years to produce 1 gramme's worth of antiprotons. By comparison, the amount contained in a Scout UFO's tank exceeds that of all the antimatter produced on Earth over the past hundred years.\n"
"\n"
"Another worrying point is that the aliens also seem to be using antimatter as part of their weapons systems. Antimatter-fuelled alien missiles are one thing; what if they begin using antimatter itself as an explosive? My staff has come up with more than one disconcerting idea along these lines. For myself, I think we should try to head the aliens off at the pass in this regard. A special program regarding antimatter-based weapons may be a highly interesting option to pursue -- it may be a more economical prospect than trying to adapt alien rockets to our interceptor craft.\n"
"\n"
"Humanity is a long, long way off from being able to create antiprotons in the amounts necessary to fuel these matter-antimatter rockets. The bottom line is, we cannot duplicate this alien technology. We don't know how they create their antimatter or how they manage to generate enough electricity to do so. Unless and until we can get our hands on this equipment, our efforts will be fruitless. Our only major successes have come from studying how the aliens store their antimatter. We are confident we can employ the same magnetic storage techniques, creating special protective pallets that will fit in our Storage facilities without any further adaptations, and we've designed antimatter fuel tanks that will fit in our interceptors, given some major overhaul. Of course we'll need a full understanding of the alien engines before we can begin incorporating it.\n"
"\n"
"For all intents and purposes, we are unable to replicate the alien fuel. If we use antimatter in our own technology we will be dependent upon recovering it from alien sources. This seems a dangerous course of action, but we may have no choice; we need to adapt this technology as soon as possible if we are to have any chance of truly stopping the invasion.\n"

"Varelsen är helt klart levande, och vi var tvugna att genomgå en omfattande blandning av toxikologiska expriment som gav oss viktig information om dess sårbarhet till olika kemikalier och bakteriesmittor. Men vi har inte kunnat producerat en beteende analys av det utomjordiska sinnet. Detta pga att exemplaret har i stort sett inte visat någon sorts intelligens sedan den tillfångatogs. Den har nästan bara ätit, sovit och stirrat in i väggen i sin förvaringscell. Den reagerar på fysisk stimulans med reflexhandlingar, aggresion och/eller undergivenhet men vi kunde inte få någon information av den. Även enkla handsignaler verkar vara utom varelsens förståelse.

"Jag har gjort en noggrann undersökning av föremålen vi hittade när vi obducerade utomjordingarna som vi har hittat. Jag tror att vi nu är redo att presentera våra slutsatser.\n"
"\n"
"Utifrån vår undersökning av vävnadstillväxt och ärrbildning runt struphuvudet drar vi slutsatsen att de här föremålen har blivit kirurgiskt implanterade i halsen vid en mycket tidig ålder. Någon gång under uppväxten tas den barnanpassade enheten bort och ersätts med en version anpassad för vuxna individer.\n"
"\n"
"Vi har undersökt flera olika möjligheter vad gäller enhetens funktion, från matförbehandlare till självmordsvapen, men det mest självklara svaret visade sig vara det riktiga. Det är en form av respirator som tillåter utomjordingarna att överleva i vår atmosfär, och möjligtvis även andra atmosfärer. Varje organiskt exemplar som vi har obducerat har haft en sådan här enhet, och alla har haft samma basfunktionalitet. Det tyder på antingen att varelserna behöver de här enheterna för att överleva i sin hemmiljö eller att vi bara har sett individer som som är tänkta för planteriska uppdrag. Helt säkert vore externa andningsapparater enklare och mer ekonomiskt att använda om de här individerna bara var tänkta att ta kortare turer i fientliga atmosfärer.\n"
"\n"
"Själva enheten består av ett sofistikerat filter som är utdraget över individens luftrör, samt två små sfäriska behållare som är placerade på var sin sida av ryggmärgen och sammankopplade med luftrören med ett litet metallrör. Behållarna är fyllda med en gasblandning som är komprimerad till flytande form och fungerar i princip som en dykares syrgastankar. Filtermekanismen är halvintelligent; den tar bort alla ämnen som är skadliga för individen, men låter alla användbara ämnen att passera. Behållarna återfylls genom en liten mekanisk navel som sitter i nacken.\n"
"\n"
"En undersökning av behållarnas innehåll har gett oss våra första tillförlitliga data om utomjordingarnas atmosfär. Vi har nu flera gasblandningar som vi tror kommer att kunna hålla varelser vid liv i våra förvaringsutrymmen. Några av blandningarna är kväve-syre-föreningar som är väldigt lika vår egen luft, medan andra inte innehåller syre alls. Om alla dessa blandningar används aktivt av en eller flera främmande raser så tycks några av våra fiender andas en atmosfär som är nästan ren metan.\n"
"\n"

"Under obduktionen av de utomjordiska kropparna som vi har hittat, upptäckte mitt forskarlag och jag ett egendomligt föremål inopererat i halsen på den främmande varelsen. Det består av två metallklot placerade på var sin sida av ryggmärgen, direkt kopplade till luftrören med en liten tub. Luftrören själva skyddas av någon form av ventil eller filter. Vi tror att den här sammankopplade apparaturen kan vara någon sorts andningsutrustning. Det kan också vara något helt annat; vi är inte säkra på hur det fungerar än.\n"

"Mitt team har gjort klart utförandet av ett antal tester på våra fångar som har fått utomjordingarnas beteende att klarna upp.\n"
"\n"
"I ett experiment, ett utomjordiskt exemplar fick en låda med mat som var låst med ett kombinationslås med två nummer. Det tog sex timmar för exemplaret att komma på kombinationen. Detta placerar utomjordingens IQ långt under jordens däggdjur; Men när andra exemplar i fångenskap gavs samma uppgift med samma lås så lyckades alla lösa kombinationen på en gång utan att ha sett det första exemplarets försök. Vi vet hur detta ser ut kommendör men jag försäkrar dig att jag och mitt team har varit grundliga och noggranna med säkerhet och separation. Utomjordingarna har inte fått kommunicera på något sätt. Vi vill inte överlämna några definitiva hypoteser om dessa händelser, men vi jobbar på det.\n"
"\n"
"Oturligt nog så är resultaten av våra experiment ofullständiga. Vi har försökt med olika typer av kommunikation utan framgång. Trots att de har fullt fungerande stämband och/eller fungerande händer, så verkar dom inte prata eller signalera på något sätt som vi kan förstå. Feromon kommunikation har inte haft någon effekt bortom enkla fysiska reaktioner. De stora biologiska skillnaderna mellan utomjordiska arter skapar också sin del av problem med förvaring och kommunikation -- Titta i Utomjordisk Obduktions rapporterna för detaljer på varje enskild utomjordisk fysiologi.\n"
"\n"
"Ändå så tror jag att vi gör framsteg även om det går sakta. Kommunikation med utomjordingarna är helt klart inom gränsen av möjligt. Våra studier visar att utomjordiska arter reagerar på yttre stimulans. Det visar att vi kan få dom att ge ett svar på ett eller annat sätt. Doktor Yamamura arbetar just nu med att lära en isolerad grupp hur man visar begär, igenkännande och förnekande. Deras intelligens är för begränsad för att försöka något mer sofistikerat just nu. När exemplaren har lärt sig dessa baskunskaper så kommer vi få in data om vilken grad som utomjordingarna kan lära sig saker, och en grund som vi kan bygga vidare på. Yamamura hoppas att vi kan öka deras kommunikations förmåga lite i taget tills de kan göra sig förstådda för oss, och därigenom sprida denna kunskap tilla andra av deras sort som kanske har ett lite större intelekt och talang.\n"

"Vi har spenderat de senaste veckorna om att undersöka de konstiga händelserna i vår förvaringsfacilitet, och vi tror att vi har formulerat en teori som kan förklara utomjordingarnas nyfunna intelligens.\n"
"\n"
"Det verkar som vi hade fel om vår preliminära värdering av hur det utomjordiska intellektet fungerar. Vi trodde först de va självständiga fungerade individer, på samma sätt som människor är, fast med överlägsen kommunikation och lagsamarbete. Men våra labb experiment och en intensiv granskning av bilder från slagfältet verkar nu motsäja den hypotesen.\n"
"\n"
"I vårt videoarkiv så har vi sett att utomjordingarna ofta söker skydd, koordinerar deras eldgivning, arbetar som ett lag även om de inte bär någon synlig kommunikationsutrustning. Men när vi fångade några levande exemplar till vår förvaringsfacilitet så visade de inget mer än nivån av djuriska instinkter. Detta verkar orimligt med de bevis vi har; stora, välutvecklad hjärnstruktur och bevisad kunskap av stridstaktiker.\n"
"\n"
"Vi försöker att förena dessa ideer i en ny hypotes, och våra experiment har börjat visa påtagliga resultat. De nya exemplaren är verkligen ansvariga för de konstiga beteenden vi har observerat, men vi trodde från början att de var befäl av något slag färgad av auktoritet. Vi tror nu att den teorin också är fel. Våra experiment bevisar att när utomjordingarna tilläts att samlas, med eller utan de misstänkta 'officerarna', så vart de mycket mer aktiva och sofistikerade. När de blir separerade från varandra med en tillräckligt lång sträcka, så återgår de till deras bastillstånd. Slutsatsen är tydlig. Det är någon sorts gemensam kraft som binder ihop dessa varelser.\n"
"\n"
"En ström av nya teorier har kommit upp. Den mest sannolika förklaringen är i utomjordingarnas hjärnor. Det finns flera raser av utomjordingar, alla möter de fysiologiska krav för en känslosam ras, men de visar lite till ingen hjärnvågs aktivitet var och en för sig. Detta innebär en närvaro av någon sorts delad eller fördelad tanke mellan dem, en svärmhjärna som växer sig mer intelligent ju fler de är. Vi vet inte säkert hur det är möjligt för denna svärmhjärna att korsa rasgränserna; det är tydligt att de olika raserna kommer från olika världar, med vida avvikande evolutionära vägar, och några raser verkar har funnits bra mycket längre än andra. Men nu när vi fått tillgång av utomjordingarnas avancerade teknologi, så är 'hur' en mindre gåta än 'varför'.\n"
"\n"
"Dessa nya upptäckter verkar också föreslå att exemplar nere på jorden inte har kontakt från källan av deras intelligens. Medans detta kan vara en viktig fördel för PHALANX styrkor, så ger det också hot vi än inte har tänkt på. Vår forskning i utomjordisk fysiologi har fastställt att isolerade exemplar inte kan överleva speciellt länge i vår miljö, och förhålla sig med knappt tillräcklig intelligens medans de är på marken; men en tillräckligt antal klarar att fly och koordinera med varandra -- eller med utomjordiska sympatisörer på jorden -- vi kan komma att se en stor risk av infiltration.\n"
"\n"
"Med flera exemplar i fångenskap, så verkar deras intelligens närma sig den mänskliga nivån. Om vi kan skapa en passande översättningsapparat eller använda vanligt språk, så tror vi kanske tillslut att vi kan kunna etablera en kommunikation med utomjordingar i PHALANX förvar. Kanske några språkforskare eller psykologer kan bilda en dialog. Detta är en förfrågan som vi inte har råd att ignorera.\n"
"\n"
"Naturligtvis så om ett sådant experiment skulle godkännas av baskommendören, så lovar jag att mitt team skulle ta alla nödvändiga försiktighetsåtgärder. Inget är mer viktigare för oss än om våra mäns liv och säkerheten av våra faciliteter.\n"

"I'm happy to report that we've received the first good results in our ongoing efforts to question captive aliens in our Containment unit. Dr. Yamamura's approach has gradually begun to bear fruit. The aliens have learned to convey messages in both binary code and human-readable sign language, and they appear to comprehend a wide range of questions and instructions. Yamamura and his staff are still working to refine the sign language we've been using, while the rest of my team has concentrated on trying to extract useful information from the hive mind. This hasn't been easy. The aliens are very reticent and require a great deal of chemical encouragement in order to put them into a more helpful frame of mind. The casualty rate has been high.\n"
"\n"
"However, what we have is significant. For instance, the hive mind seems to have no identity. It seems unable to grasp concepts like \"I\" or \"We\", or even \"You\" and \"Them\". It only accepts these words as numerical differentiations -- one specimen or several, one human or a group. This indicates a severe disconnect between human and alien thinking. The shared consciousness doesn't even think of itself as a single enclosed entity; it merely is. This, along with various other answers we've pieced together from our continued sessions, leads us to believe that all aliens do indeed share one single mind. And I mean all of them, Commander. It's not simply a means of increasing team efficiency or encouraging esprit de corps; it's an indispensible component of alien society. Every alien that lives and breathes is an equal and identical part of the greater hive mind, even specimens of completely different species. The only diversity the aliens will acknowledge is in the different substances required to keep the various species alive.\n"
"\n"
"Also, the hive mind has expressed puzzlement at our attempts to communicate with individual aliens, let alone through something as crude as sign language. A human-understandable analogy might be trying to have a deep conversation with someone's toenail, or talking to a single cell in your own body. Of course, that raises the question of where the alien ears and brain really are.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly the handful of aliens currently in our Containment unit are not part of the greater hive mind that we hypothesize exists on the alien homeworld. They seem to be cut off from it for the duration of their mission to Earth, only to rejoin it when they return later. Whether this is due to distance or some kind of atmospheric effect, we've not yet been able to tell. The aliens' answers are hazy on this subject.\n"
"\n"
"That is all I have to report, Commander. However, as a final note, I would like to request your permission to look into methods we could use to more effectively persuade our captives. I must also stress that we require a healthy influx of new alien specimens in order to replace losses. We have to maintain the isolated hive mind we have in Containment. Losing it now would be a significant setback to our research.\n"

"\n"
"(Odd Behaviour)\"There are several species of alien, all of which meet the physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show little to no brainwave activity of their own.

The divergence of species has been a problem, as some compounds will work on one type of alien but not on another, but with this new data it will be an easy task to whip up drugs specifically tailored to the individual alien species.\n"
"\n"
"Subjects under the influence of this drug have proven to be more pliable and loose-lipped, as long as we keep injecting all the specimens in our containment unit. Unfortunately the hive mind's natural resistance to interrogation is still throwing a spanner in the works. Even with all our specimens fully injected, we've not managed to break that resistance, and the accuracy of our test information has still not been 100% reliable. All data we receive still requires some degree of time-consuming verification work.\n"

"As you may know, our efforts at communication with the live aliens in our Containment unit are progressing only very slowly. We're having a great deal of trouble applying our standard interrogation methods. The truth serum we have available has several distinct limitations; it tends to produce a lethal allergic reaction in most alien bodies unless we restrict it to smaller, insufficient doses, which worsens the serum's already incomplete effect on alien physiology. We've encountered numerous small lies and half-truths in the sessions we've taken so far. Torture has been attempted to influence this behaviour, but to no avail. Pain seems to have no corrective effect on the hive mind.\n"
"\n"
"There's also the larger hurdle of having to inject every single specimen of the hive mind in order to properly submerge any subject's sense of judgment. If one member of the hive mind dies, the remaining specimens' adrenaline-equivalent levels rise to the point where we have to start over.\n"
"\n"
"To this end, armed with our expanded knowledge of the alien mind and body, I propose a new research program to look into a universal set of sera that we can use to extract more reliable information, faster and more easily. There is obviously a great deal of information inside these specimens waiting to be seized, Commander; we just need the tools to properly crack the shell.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' -- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the UFO we captured. It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward to getting a chance to sink our own hooks into all this lovely technology.\n"
"\n"
"The craft's strange construction has raised a lot of questions for us to answer. Much of the design seems to make little sense when viewed from the ground. However, now that we've managed to look at it up close and personal -- and test the alien hull materials under laboratory conditions -- we have gained a far clearer picture of UFO capabilities. I've made a list of our most important discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"-- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to keep it cool and to reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electrical needs.\n"
"\n"
"-- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but even so I nearly had a heart attack when we found out what was in there. If a containment loss occurred on one of these tanks, even three tenths of a gramme of this antimatter would outstrip the explosive force of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as possible within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to jettison the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on the tank or the containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion represents an extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is that proton-antiproton explosions create little radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"-- The craft is extremely difficult to see with human detection equipment, regardless of any electronic warfare capability on the aliens' part. This is largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of radiation. We've had the most luck with passive infrared and gamma radiation detection, as the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"-- The slim design, generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in air, is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. It would be impossible to create effective wings from the alien hull materials. Instead, every gramme of excess matter has been stripped off, and the craft moves at high speeds so as to need very little lift surface. The material itself is quite astonishing, part metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a memory alloy, 'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a more compact form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a more comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's stronger and tougher than any known material on Earth (barring pure carbon nanotubes) and far more versatile in aircraft design. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"Armed with these facts, we can now begin to analyse the different components and roles of the UFO. I recommend that our engineers begin dismantling this craft for parts right away. Who knows what we'll discover with the individual bits and pieces in front of us?\n"
"\n"
"More research on the UFO itself is also warranted. I think we can delve deeper into its intended function and perhaps gain some insight in how to counter its activities. I'll send you another proposal about it as soon as I can.\n"

Are any of its systems still active or boobytrapped? What kind of materials is it made of? What dangers might it pose during storage or disassembly? All these questions and more need to be answered before we do anything further.\n"

The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"This magazine contains 12 rounds of 7.62x25mm TT (Tokarev) pistol ammunition. It is a conventional staggered-stack box design. Though the original TT bullet design is ancient, the rounds in this magazine are brand-new and ready for service, reinforced with steel and tungsten to withstand the tremendous force of the powder explosion. This round is an excellent penetrator, able to punch through heavy armour at close range. However, it's also reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy. Combined with super-high-velocity powder, these rounds also have a kick like a mule. A two-handed firing stance is recommended for most users to avoid the chance of breaking a wrist.\n"

The very concept of the pistol in military use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used in fully-automatic weapons, since no firearms action on this Earth can survive that much violence for long without breaking. The British APMP pistol ignores these concerns by using more ordinary smokeless powder and a longer, almost SMG-length barrel to achieve higher velocities and greater kinetic power. It is a true machine pistol, fully automatic and capable of firing 600 rounds per minute from its surprisingly slim-lined 30-round detachable box magazine. It has three firing modes: semi-automatic, 3-round burst, and full-automatic.\n"
"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through kevlar like it wasn't there. Once inside a human body this tiny round tumbles like a madman and creates huge wound cavities. It has a deal of trouble penetrating modern body armour, but this is offset by the APMP's ability to deliver repeated hits from its large magazine, all in a pistol-sized package. Unfortunately, the APMP can be a little unwieldy due to its size. Accuracy during burst and fully-automatic fire suffers as a result.\n"

It is a good alternative for soldiers who have trouble hitting anything with the P-12, but the MP-699 is low-powered in comparison with the P-12. Furthermore, its magazines are large enough to preclude hanging them from a soldier's belt and far fewer of them can be carried conveniently.\n"

"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in 2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums contain 100 rounds each. This allows the GPG to be used almost as a heavy assault rifle. The magazines are on the bulky side, but still small and light enough for an average soldier to carry several of them into battle.\n"
"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 Assault Rifle. Unfortunately the magazines are not interchangeable between Assault Rifle and GPG, as the Assault Rifle uses a different feed system.\n"

"The South-African MPMDS (Multi-Purpose Missile Delivery System) has a classic, almost surgically clean name that completely belies its purpose. It is the heaviest infantry missile launcher on the market, able to fire anti-tank shells as easily as high-explosive rockets that turn infantry into hamburger. Originally intended as light field artillery, this weapon is fairly new; its only combat experience has been in Mumbai in the hands of Commonwealth troops. It was one of the handful of weapons that eventually turned the tide in the fighting -- and there is a good reason why.\n"
"\n"
"Alien craft on the ground emit fantastic amounts of jamming and other EW (Electronic Warfare) activity. In fact, they emit so much of it that ordinary 'smart' missiles are rendered completely ineffective. If one type of alien EW doesn't fool the missile's relatively stupid electronic brain, another will. No amount of tinkering by Earth's military engineers has been able to fix the situation. The MPMDS, however, will remain effective against the alien invaders -- one of the few human missile launchers that can -- because its rockets carry no onboard guidance.\n"
"\n"
"The rockets are 120mm monsters the size of artillery shells. They are fired out of a smoothbore barrel, fin-stabilised in flight, and have a maximum effective range of 70 metres. Surprisingly they are made up of only three parts: a rocket booster, a warhead and an impact trigger. This simplicity allows them to remain effective and reliable in the most hazardous situations. Though the rockets are not very accurate, they will devastate anything in their path, even aliens. It takes only one good hit from an MPMDS rocket to send the enemy flying.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for this launcher includes: HE (High-Explosive) rockets, AA (Anti-Armour) rockets, and IC (Incendiary) rockets. New types of MPMDS ammo were being researched by Commonwealth manufacturers before the start of the war. We have all their data on file and could use it to create revolutionary new rocket types.\n"
"\n"
"Along with the HPGL Grenade Launcher, this weapon will provide our troops the artillery support they need to survive and win through.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rocket launcher the classification HPML.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPML is best used in a support role, providing covering fire for our assault troops with high-explosive and/or incendiary rockets. However, care should be taken that friendly fire incidents do not occur, as this could have disastrous effects in a combat mission.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we can make it.\n"

"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

"The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in human history, we've created a viable man-portable electromagnetic weapon. We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with other existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my best to explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
"\n"
"The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to a coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and generally poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising electromagnetic force to propel an electrically conductive projectile along two conducting rails. The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each reload) and a small ammo capacity of 4 shots per barrel. On the other hand, the Bolter's stopping power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our arsenal. It can be used both as a sniper rifle and a powerful assault weapon, depending on whether it is fired on semi-automatic or 4-round burst mode. It is a highly versatile weapon with many possible applications; its tactical value will certainly become apparent once we get some real combat experience with it.\n"

"Commander, we've received a number of research files from several UN nations concerning research and development for man-portable electromagnetic weaponry; various designs have been proposed and even prototyped for railguns, coilguns and quench guns. Of course, all these experiments have failed, since electromagnetic weapons require huge amounts of power -- and therefore banks of capacitors so heavy that no human soldier could possibly carry them. Even atomic batteries have not given us the power output we need to make man-portable electromagnetic guns a reality. It is impossible.\n"
"\n"
"At least, that's what we thought, until the aliens showed up.\n"
"\n"
"Seeing alien craft hurtling through our skies, advanced robots scuttling through our streets, and high-powered energy weapons tearing up our people has given us a whole host of new ideas. It has also caused us to take a very close look through our collected UN research data. It's nothing short of a gold mine in disguise. By combining the best of these individual cluttered pieces, we believe we may be able to devise a new weapon for our tactical teams that will be both man-portable and combat-effective.

As a weapon, the combat knife's edge is reinforced with hard ceramics to give it extra armour-piercing power, and it is balanced for throwing should the need arise. It also has a bayonet ring for affixing the knife to the barrel of an old-style battle rifle.\n"
"\n"
"The inclusion of the combat knife in our arsenal was a subject of hot debate. Mumbai has taught us that even in the most favourable conditions, a knife is no match for the aliens' weaponry. If a knife-equipped soldier isn't shot down before he even reaches his target, he will almost certainly be gutted by one of the wicked alien blades that slice right through armour. Only in a handful of occasions have experienced knife-fighters been able to win out against alien opponents.\n"
"\n"
"Still, the combat knife has saved many a life over the years when firearms became inoperable or ran out of ammo. It has never been rendered obsolete by centuries of progressing technology; even the aliens use bladed weapons.

"Commander, I'm hereby reporting our success in the creation of alien blade materials. We've loaded the production specs into our Workshop machinery and have constructed a small forge for shaping our new monomolecular knives.\n"
"\n"
"The reproduction process has been very interesting on this one. After we'd figured out how to 'cook' the alien plastics to the right temperatures, we ended up with bars of incredibly hard material which we then tried to shape into knives. On our first attempts we tried to create a straight-edged blade with a powerful point, like most modern combat knives, so that it could be used for both cutting and stabbing. All of these models snapped in half during the cooling process. We had a devil of a time figuring out why until we placed a small camera inside the furnace.\n"
"\n"
"It turns out that the curve of the Kerrblade isn't a design choice -- it's a function of the material itself. The plastic radically curves and expands during heat-moulding in our furnace, and contracts again during cooling, which ended up cracking all of our straight-edged blades. It demands a particular curved shape to retain its durability as a blade. We had to completely redesign the knife to account for this effect, which brought it to its current shape.\n"
"\n"
"In length, it's either a long knife or a short sword, depending on who you ask. The design of the handle and crossguard are based on Middle-Eastern and Asian swordmaking traditions mixed in with modern-day science and know-how. The handle is made from semi-solid rubber, which automatically moulds itself to the wielder's hand to maximise comfort and gripping power. Both the triangular crossguard and pommel are unbreakable carbon-nanotube-reinforced plastic, a material that even Kerrblades have trouble with.\n"
"\n"
"This knife goes a long way towards evening the odds for our soldiers when they get caught in hand-to-hand. Though it's larger than our old combat knife, doesn't thrust as well, and doesn't have the power of the Kerrblade's sword-length swing, it strikes an ideal middle ground between these two weapons. The monomolecular knife is almost the equal of the Kerrblade in lethality but still small enough to be worn in our standard holster or in a sheath hung from the belt. It amounts to a significant upgrade of our melee combat capabilities, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the result.\n"

"Commander, now that we've had a good look at the alien blade technology from several sources -- the Bloodspider's 'fangs' and the Kerrblade -- we're starting to form a picture of how to recreate the unknown or ill-understood materials used in their construction.\n"
"\n"
"Some of this stuff is completely new to us. The plastics from which the alien blades are forged are harder than damascus steel, sharper than a razor, and yet shock-resistant and flexible enough to survive the stresses of melee combat. Once forged they are nearly impossible to break, nick or bend. Applying a hammer and chisel directly to the blade just means you end up with two neatly-sliced halves of a chisel.\n"

"Obviously it would be of great interest to us if we could create our own knives made from these materials, with edges tapering to the width of a single molecule. My team and I believe it may now be possible.\n"

"The concept of the fragmentation grenade has changed little since it was first conceived, when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or metal containers. It only solidified further after the end of the 20th century. Improvements in explosive technology and casing materials have made them a little faster and a little deadlier, but the mechanics are the same: An explosive substance at the heart of the grenade causes the casing (and possibly additional payload such as a layer of wire or white phosphorus coiled around the explosive) to fragment into shrapnel and fly in all directions at high speed, killing or wounding targets in the area of effect. The delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and then releasing the handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It will detonate after a period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX purposes, we’ve selected the Australian HG15 as the best of the lot. This grenade is loaded with an extremely conventional charge of C8 solid chemical explosive, an inner layer of coiled wire, and an outer layer of thin plated steel. It's designed to maximise coverage by putting out more shrapnel than any other grenade on the market. The HG15's outer layer is smooth and unbroken, unlike the old 'pineapple' grenades of World War 2, to make it easier to roll across various surfaces. The C8 explosive at its core may be old in design, but it's both highly powerful and can be counted on to work right under harsh conditions. Reliability is an especially important attribute in any kind of hand-held bomb.\n"

Their range is highly limited and their casualty radius is small. However, if the situation calls for close-range indirect fire or something deadly thrown around a corner, the frag grenade is just the thing.\n"
"\n"
"Care should be taken that no friendlies (especially civilians) are caught in the area of effect. In such situations the use of lethal grenades is strongly discouraged; flashbangs should be given preference.\n"

Once thrown, the body of the grenade explodes, spreading the incendiary compound over the surrounding area -- and anyone unlucky enough to be inside the area of effect.

"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 9 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes; timed shot, which will detonate grenades at a set time after leaving the barrel, and airburst, which will detonate grenades in the air after they have travelled a certain distance. The RA6's maximum rate of fire is one round per second on semi-automatic, or it can rapidly cycle through its cylinder on burst mode, firing quick three-round bursts that can devastate whole areas.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for the RA6 is the 25mm HIT (High Impulse Thermobaric) grenade, which is a 'fuel-air munition' that uses atmospheric oxygen to generate an explosion instead of carrying along an oxidising agent. Thermobaric weapons produce a far more powerful explosive force than would be possible with conventional explosives of the same size. They rely on explosive energy, concussion and heat for their lethality rather than on fragmentation like most conventional explosives.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and infantry artillery piece.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPGL is a tactician's dream come true. It has excellent damage and range, can hit several clustered targets with one blast, and can be used for special tasks such as area denial with incendiary grenades. It can be as effective in close situations as it is in large open spaces; however, different tactics are required.\n"
"\n"
"The airburst mode is preferable for use in open ground; it sacrifices some range by taking away the 'bounce' factor, but this also has its benefits. The bounce factor can seriously foul accuracy if the grenade lands on an uneven surface and can allow the enemy to run away or take cover before detonation. Airburst fire also allows the operator to place his grenades exactly where he wants them. Unless there is a catastrophic detonator failure, any airburst fired from the HPGL will go off at the intended spot with little chance for mechanical error.\n"
"\n"
"In close situations, timed grenades can be bounced off walls and around corners to reach dangerous or inconvenient places that other weapons have trouble getting a bead on. However, care should be taken that the operator doesn't fire shots that leave himself or any friendly troops inside the blast radius. This would make the operator very unpopular with what's left of the team. Due to the bounce factor on timed grenades, they can also be a severe hazard to nearby civilians. Use of the grenade launcher in situations where civilians might become victim to collateral damage is strongly discouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For close-range emergency work -- for example if the operator has no sidearm -- the launcher can also be loaded with special 25mm flechette shells similar to our shotgun shells. These have less damage potential than shotgun shells due to their lower muzzle velocity, but they can still be deadly in close quarters and, unlike explosive grenades, are not a risk to the operator at short ranges.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"Along with sniper rifles and rocket launchers, this is one of the few standard-issue human weapons that are fully effective against robotic aliens."

"For this project, we already had ready access to all the required technology. We've made very few changes to the general design of the grenade. The only real challenge was to shrink the complex machinery enough to fit inside a standard 25mm shell. We've had to scale back the power of the plasma grenade somewhat in order to do that -- the hydrogen core of our new 25mm shell is a fair bit smaller, emitting less plasma than the alien hand grenade.

"Commander, our heavy laser program has been a success. We've got it prototyped and ready to go into production at your say-so.\n"

"As promised, the heavy laser is a revolution in our heavy weapons arsenal. In the hands of a qualified soldier, it can provide long-range continuous wave fire that is both far more accurate than conventional heavy weapons and far more powerful than our other infantry laser designs. We in DivEngine have no doubt that it will serve a vital role throughout the war.\n"
"\n"
"This is not to say the heavy laser doesn't have its downsides. For one, it's very bulky and very heavy, requiring a strong troop to shoot it effectively. It doesn't sacrifice accuracy despite its size, but it's less quick to fire or respond than we would like, and its ammo consumption is staggering. It can chew through a full deuterium-fluoride cartridge in only 30 seconds of continuous fire. This requires a large number of magazines to be kept on hand, and the heavy laser is not particularly quick to reload.\n"

"Another weakness is the fact that the heavy laser cannot shoot through clouds of smoke, gas or fire. All our lasers have this problem; clouds of material will quickly refract the beam into harmless light, so we'll have to be careful about our application of smoke and incendiary weapons. Great care will also have to be taken that no bystanders or PHALANX troops get into the path of the invisible beam. Even momentary exposure to an unobstructed beam will char bone and liquefy flesh. A hit to the eyes will result in permanent, irreparable blindness. We've talked to our training and field officers about this and have underlined safety in our field manual at every turn, but it won't hurt the troops to hear it again from you, Commander.\n"
"\n"
"Robotic or armoured aliens may be able to survive a beam for some time, even from a heavy laser, before their armour fails. It's recommended to engage these with several soldiers at once and concentrate fire in order to bring them down as quickly as possible.\n"
"\n"
"It's also recommended that you not replace all our conventional heavy weapons with heavy lasers, Commander. We need a good balance of weapons to play to the strengths of our troops and to the weaknesses of the aliens. A varied arsenal is a healthy arsenal, and can't be easily defended against.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"Infrared night-vision imaging has been used on battlefields for generations, and miniaturisation technology has allowed it to become part of a soldier's standard issue for nighttime operations. Advances in electronics over the last 30 years have allowed IR imaging equipment to shrink to the size of swimming goggles with no loss of efficiency.\n"
"\n"
"These goggles pick up all infrared emissions in the area and display them on the inside of the lenses. They can be easily worn for the duration of a nighttime engagement, greatly extending a soldier's visual range in the darkness and allowing him to see targets through thin walls. Thick walls present a greater obstacle and may obscure targets inside entirely. Of course, there is no way to distinguish between the IR signatures of civilians and those of aliens whenever we do not have direct line of sight. Any readings taken through walls or other obstacles will not be conclusive.\n"
"\n"
"Our IR goggles will work even during the day, though their effectiveness will be greatly reduced in daylight.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, this technology does have its drawbacks. Wearing goggles limits the soldier's peripheral vision and reduces hand-eye coordination, causing a slight drop in accuracy. They will hamper a soldier's eyesight as long as they are worn. Worse, our records from Mumbai confirm that some aliens with low heat emissions don't show up on infrared at all. Detection range for these aliens will actually be reduced, allowing them to sneak up on us if no other members of the team are in range to spot the approaching threat.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, these goggles will increase our nighttime performance exponentially, making night engagements much more survivable for our troops. However, they are not and will never be a foolproof substitute for the Mk. 1 Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We should use these items sparingly and tactically to avoid costly mistakes. It is recommended that no more than half the team wear goggles during an engagement in order to avoid surprises. Two-man fireteams -- one man equipped with goggles, one man with normal eyesight -- are recommended for maximum battlefield effectiveness.\n"
"\n"
"Using goggles during daytime is generally contraindicated, as they lose most of their utility in daylight conditions. The only reason to continue wearing them under such conditions is their limited ability to see through walls.\n"
"\n"
"Close-range combat troops will suffer least from the accuracy penalty inflicted by IR goggles. However, longer-range shooters cannot afford this penalty, as a missed shot with one of these weapons may have dire consequences. Snipers in particular will have infrared laser targeting available via their scopes anyway.\n"

"Our analysis of the Kerrblade is complete, Commander. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our combat knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've concluded it is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were doing, until now.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to cut up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they like. The large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into the solar plexus, then moved upwards like a pair of scissors, or a can opener. It goes through the sternum with disturbing ease. At this point the alien will fold open the ribcage and rip or cut out whatever he needs.\n"
"\n"
"I wish we could just burn the things, but unfortunately they're too damned valuable. Though not primarily designed as weapons these Kerrblades are far more effective than any human combat knife. They cut up aliens almost as well as humans. The grip is highly uncomfortable for human hands, but we can adapt human grips easily enough. However, the blades are too big to ever fit into the standard-issue PHALANX holster. They can only be kept in a soldier's hands or in the backpack. This somewhat defeats the purpose of a knife -- but obviously we have no other melee weapon that even comes close in terms of power.\n"

"Commander, I apologise in advance if my typing isn't up to standard in this message. We've had a lot of sleepless nights down here in DivEngine working on the laser pistol project. It's been a gruelling amount of work, but I'm very proud to say that we've pulled it off. We have prototyped a working laser pistol.\n"
"\n"
"The system is essentially the same as the one I've outlined for you in my report on Continuous Wave Laser Operation. Excited molecules of deuterium fluoride are lased and focused through a series of intelligent lenses. Waste gases are put through our custom filtering system, which we've scaled down even further. However, the reduced capacity of the filtering system and the smaller optical resonator have demanded some tradeoffs.\n"
"\n"
"The laser pistol can only lase deuterium-fluoride at about half the rate as our old Continuous Wave Laser prototype. Naturally this produces only a half-strength beam, doing half the damage of a larger weapon. It requires a period of continuous exposure -- several seconds at least -- for the beam to inflict enough damage to kill an unarmoured target. Armour will complicate the issue even further, and it's impossible for lasers to shoot through clouds of smoke, gas or fire. Still, as long as the target isn't obscured or immune to highly-focused light or heat, the laser will burn through anything given enough time.\n"
"\n"
"All the usual advantages of laser weaponry are present in the pistol. It's very quick to fire, and if the soldier misses his target at first, he can adjust his aim without letting go of the trigger. And there's another bonus particular to our pistol design. Thanks to the extremely high accuracy inherent in laser weaponry, it will be easy for ambidextrous soldiers to use two laser pistols at once.\n"
"\n"
"We've designed the pistol to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges which we've drawn up to power all of our laser weaponry. This means it uses the same amount of D-F as the larger designs, but uses it up at a much lower rate, effectively giving the laser pistol more ammunition than any of our other laser weapons.\n"
"\n"
"As with all handguns, the laser pistol is strictly a backup weapon. It isn't powerful enough to compete with rifles of any kind. On the other hand, the laser pistol completely eliminates the problems regarding range and accuracy that plague conventional handguns. Its range is quite impressive indeed for a handgun. It can shoot out to 60 metres with pinpoint accuracy thanks to the aim-correcting lenses, and it can fire continuously for minutes without reloading. This will make it particularly valuable in wide open terrain.\n"

We've eliminated several moving parts and refined the electronics to bring production and maintenance costs down into our budget range. I believe you'll find the weapon's specs to your satisfaction.\n"
"\n"
"This rifle is possibly the most accurate weapon ever designed. It's light, rests easily in the shooter's hands, and the focusing lenses automatically correct the user's aim to help bring the beam on target -- and keep it there. It may inflict less damage per shot than its conventional projectile-firing counterparts, but it can do more over time if the shooter keeps the target in his sights. Eight troops with conventional assault rifles firing away at full-auto can easily miss a moving target. With laser rifles, that becomes a near-impossibility.\n"
"\n"
"It is quick to fire, has a good magazine capacity, no recoil, a respectable range and does away with many other issues that plague conventional firearms. It will never misfire or suffer a jammed mechanism. It will never blow up due to a fouled or bent barrel. It will never have problems with incompatible or faulty ammunition. It can suffer cracked lenses if subjected to severe mistreatment, but those are thoroughly shielded, set into shock-resistant foam and protected from the outside by a metal iris that only opens when the weapon is ready to fire.\n"
"\n"
"The laser rifle's biggest weakness is its inability to shoot through clouds of smoke, gas or fire. All our lasers have this problem; clouds of material will quickly refract the beam into harmless light, so we'll have to be careful about our application of smoke and incendiary weapons.\n"

Our soldiers need ruggedness in a rifle, something that will last through the bumps and bashes of combat, and we badly need to bring down production costs to make the program worthwhile. As it is, the price of a squad of working laser rifles would be on par with your average main battle tank. We need funding and lab time to bring costs down, fix or replace the most sensitive components to make the weapon more reliable, and reduce its form factor to something that can be comfortably fired by a human soldier.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we can make it.\n"

"\n"
"This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is extremely complex and inventive, requiring a great deal of technical skill to create. The power pack alone is hundreds of years ahead of our technology. It stores enough power to heat several charges of hydrogen to a plasmatic state inside the miniature fusion chamber, which are expelled as plasma using the ionised particles' own velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike human firearms, the projectiles themselves are not stored in a magazine or reservoir. They are generated inside the pistol from hydrogen contained in the magazine, powered by the magazine's power-pack. Once the plasma is heated, a thin film of liquid plastic is created between the two 'spinnerets' located vertically opposite each other in front of the grip. The plasma particles are then rapidly fired into the film so that the plastic deforms into an orb or 'bolt'. The plastic contains and protects the plasma, keeping it from dispersing until it reaches the target. By the time a bolt reaches the target, the inside of the plastic will be so eaten away that it will burst upon impact like a soap bubble, splashing its payload across the target. The maximum range of a pistol bolt -- the point it can reach before the plasma eats into open air and disperses -- is approximately 20 metres.\n"
"\n"
"A bolt fired from the plasma pistol is so hot that even a near-miss can be lethal. The effects on a victim are truly horrific; I will try to list them all here.\n"
"\n"
"Any unarmoured human sprayed with this plasma will suffer extreme pain and injuries all across the splash zone. Adipose (fatty) tissue will melt like water. Blood and other bodily fluids boil in place. The plasma will actually eat its way into a human body, causing bone-deep charring in a large region around the splash zone. A large chunk of the body will be literally burnt to a crisp.\n"
"\n"
"Any kind of tough fabric will provide some protection against a plasma hit. High-tech armour in particular will disperse the heat as best it can, and will resist the burning plasma for a time. Hopefully this will be enough time to allow air-cooling to take place, bringing the plasma down to non-lethal temperatures.\n"
"\n"
"I won't pretend to know how the aliens managed to squeeze all this stuff into a pistol, but it does look as though they've made the same tradeoffs between power and size that we have done with our handguns. It's almost certain that larger, more powerful versions of these weapons exist and will appear against us in this war. However, my team and I have figured out the control scheme of the pistols, and we've written an appropriate field manual for human use.

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma blaster research.\n"
"\n"
"This is by far the heaviest member we've observed out of the plasma weapon family, and it seems unlikely that they will get any larger. The blaster requires at least two people and a heavy-duty cart to get it in and out of secure storage. It's barely man-portable, requiring a troop with great strength to carry it into battle. It is so large that, if it were a vehicle-mounted piece, it wouldn't even fit on most of our UGVs. The magazines weigh nearly a kilogramme apiece and the plasma generated is hot enough to melt through conventional armoured vehicles.\n"
"\n"
"One of the notable improvements over the plasma rifle is the blaster's increased range, made possible by thicker containment plastic and higher bolt speeds. Ballistic testing has confirmed that blaster shots can reach distances of up to 400m before dispersing. The accuracy may be poor, but the blaster also has a far higher rate of fire. A heavy-duty plasma chamber and upgraded plastic spinnerets can produce up to 250 rounds per minute. Unfortunately for us, despite the containment plastic's increased thickness, the bolts will still burst and deploy their plasma properly even at extreme close range. This makes the blaster highly dangerous at all ranges at which PHALANX troops may encounter it. We recommend that any enemies found carrying one be neutralised ASAP, as they are an extreme threat to everyone and everything in the line of fire.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to use the blaster mostly in the role of heavy machine gun and anti-vehicle weapon. Another interesting fact is that their use is almost completely exclusive to the Ortnok species. Most Tamans -- like most humans -- would have extreme difficulty trying to lift and aim one and require mechanical assistance to do so. Cybernetic enhancements and/or the development of powered armour would certainly rectify many of the blaster's inherent weaknesses from a human point of view.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, we've mapped out the weapon's full control scheme for you, which is documented in the attached field manual. Our troops should now be able to train with and use the plasma blaster in combat as any other weapon, provided they're able to lift it.\n"

"\n"
"We were wrong to think of the plasma blade as a knife. In essence, it is a one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving grace is that it's not very accurate, and while it can be thrown, its chances of achieving a seal when thrown are very slim. Planting one by hand has a much higher chance of success. If an alien manages to rush our troops while wielding a plasma blade, anything in the immediate area will be in danger. All available fire should be brought to bear to neutralise the target before it has the chance to hit anyone.\n"
"\n"
"This weapon frightens me, Commander. Its very existence implies a lot of things. Combined with the aliens' usual pragmatism with regards to their own lives, it says to me that they may be prepared to employ kamikaze tactics, sacrificing their own lives just to kill one of us. 1 human for 1 alien is a ratio that neither PHALANX nor humanity can possibly afford. Even if it was closer to 10: 1 I still wouldn't fancy our chances. After all, how many of them are there?\n"

At least, we assume it's a weapon; the shape seems to suggest some kind of plasma-based knife, though I have no idea how this would work.

"Commander, our assessment of the alien plasma grenade is complete. Like all the alien weapons, it's very nasty and very dangerous.\n"
"\n"
"The device is essentially made up of seven components: a casing, a trigger, a battery, a timer, an explosive charge, a plasma chamber and a solid hydrogen core. The casing is specially shaped to create a toroidal blast zone around the grenade, concentrating power into a smaller area. The battery is highly powerful and barely within our power to duplicate. The trigger is of particular interest, because it contains a tiny thumbprint scanner which verifies that the grenade is not being accidentally activated. A legitimate (i.e. non-accidental) activation starts the timer countdown. The length of the countdown is variable depending on the number of seconds that the trigger is held down, but it has a built-in safe minimum of three seconds.\n"
"\n"
"Once the timer reaches zero, the battery unleashes its power, heating a core of hydrogen to plasma in milliseconds. The explosive charge sends the grenade tumbling into the air, and once the grenade achieves vertical orientation and ideal height, the plasma chamber containment is switched off. Rapid expansion of the plasma causes the casing to burst, spraying high-velocity fragments and plasma particles all over the area of effect. Due to the unstable nature of uncontained plasma, the grenade has a limited blast radius, beyond which the plasma particles cool and slow down too much to be dangerous. This radius is approximately 50% larger than that of a standard human frag grenade.\n"
"\n"
"Anything caught within the area of effect will be either severely injured or dead.\n"
"\n"
"We've drawn up a set of blueprints that will allow our Workshops to begin immediate construction, and a manual to train our soldiers in its use. They will now be able to use the plasma grenade as any other grenade in our arsenal.\n"

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma shots are much thicker than the pistol's, only beginning to disintegrate at distances between 80-100m. This is a short maximum range for a general-purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements and other close-quarters work. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes the plasma rifle highly accurate at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high -- approx. 180 rounds per minute -- and the recoil is difficult to handle, but it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to kill a human in light or medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"
"\n"
"There can be no doubt that this weapon was designed and manufactured for war, and not in any defensive capacity. The aliens clearly know armed conflict very well. The rifle's power and lethality do not imply that they invaded us because of some mistake or misunderstanding. They came to Earth with a plan, Commander, and that really scares me.\n"

"Commander, we've finished analysing the alien needler gun, and I've prepared a threat assessment and technical overview for you.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned in my research proposal, the needler is indeed a type of sniper rifle, but an unusual one. It ignores the normal concept of firing powerful slugs to make single, long-range kills. Instead it vomits out hundreds and hundreds of ultra-fast silicon steel needles which can easily tear apart a target at any range.\n"
"\n"
"The needles are fired by a fast-changing magnetic field inside the barrel, hooked up to a feed mechanism that injects thousands of needles a minute into the barrel. This creates a near-constant stream of fire which lasts for as long as you hold down the trigger and the magazine holds out. Unlike bullets, these needles have a practically flat trajectory from muzzle to target. They punch through most armour like it doesn't exist. They're so low in mass that there's little appreciable recoil when firing, giving them excellent accuracy, but at the same time thin enough to avoid being overly affected by weather. Wind, rain and physical obstructions can knock some of the needles off course but not enough to make the weapon much less effective.\n"
"\n"
"One of the main components that caught my attention is the powerful electromagnet array. It's laid out as a 'coilgun', many electromagnetic coils wrapped around the barrel, a method we'd previously thought to be too energy-inefficient to use on the battlefield. The aliens seem to have made it viable through clever use of superconductors and alien engineering. We may be able to adapt this technology to our own EM weapons research, I'll take a closer look and get back to you when I have anything concrete.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of an ordinary top-mounted sniper scope, the aliens have incorporated a highly effective holographic aiming mechanism and rangefinder which projects directly in front of the user's leading eye. Targets are shown with absolute clarity at any range, the sight automatically compensates for natural body motions, and it will even tell the user the exact chances of scoring a hit at any time. We've run this thing by our own troops and -- once they got used to it -- the alien holo-sight was the preferred choice by an amazing 100% compared to our own scopes. If we can adapt and duplicate this sight in a self-contained package, we could create the ultimate aiming unit to use on any of our rifles, possibly even some handguns.\n"
"\n"
"Equipped with a bipod for prone firing and a very large magazine, the needler is a serious threat to our troops. Snipers can inflict serious casualties on exposed troops and we cannot afford the losses. If a needler is spotted, our soldiers will have to make optimal use of cover and try to flank whilst staying out of sight. A direct assault on an entrenched needler gun will likely prove suicidal and I don't recommend anyone to try it, Commander.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for sheer short-range devastation. Its speed combined with flechette ammo makes for a deadly mix that can be relied upon to quickly dispatch any enemy stupid enough to get into range.\n"

"Designed and manufactured in mainland China, the Ohm 55 SMG is one of the most frightening weapons to come out of the Second Cold War. It was first prototyped in 2035 by scientists working for the Communist Chinese government. Production models were only trickling into government units by the end of the war, but the rebel and Commonwealth troops quickly learned to respect the Ohm's ferocity.\n"
"\n"
"Its rate of fire at full auto exceeds 1200 rounds per minute. It can chew through a 50-round magazine in three seconds. It fires an upgraded version of the Belgian 5.7mm armour-piercing round, a steel penetrator with aluminium core, which can tear kevlar like paper and tumbles brutally through flesh and bone. Even modern ballistic fibre cannot stop this round at anything closer than 12 metres. The Ohm 55 has dominated the field of SMGs for the past 50 years and will continue to do so for at least the next decade.\n"
"\n"
"The Ohm is highly manoeuvrable with a short barrel and sleek lines, but can suffer from excessive muzzle climb on full auto due to the sheer weight of lead the weapon puts out. Autofire also tends to empty the magazine before the shooter even realises he's holding down the trigger. Still, after nearly 50 years in service around the world, this remains the Ohm 55's only known design flaw.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment.

"The 'Artificial Fog' smoke grenade was developed by the African league of nations during the war on the diamond cartels. It is an ingenious design which proves that, even in the age of electronic perception, the smoke grenade hasn't outlived its usefulness. There is no vision system that cannot be defeated somehow, and upgraded smoke grenades like the Artificial Fog grenade can block infrared sighting equipment as easily as they block the Mk. 1 Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"The Artificial Fog grenade is what is called a 'bursting' smoke grenade. Instead of pouring smoke out of holes in the top, it bursts apart much like an incendiary grenade and covers a large area of ground with titanium tetrachloride, which quickly produces vast clouds of corrosive white smoke. It also fills the air with minuscule 'chaff', flakes of iron that refract radar waves and generally muck up the electronic picture of the battlefield. Other trace additives to the smoke help refract most of the non-visible EM spectrum. Even alien technology has trouble sifting through the thick soup.\n"
"\n"
"Titanium tetrachloride smoke by itself is slightly harmful to human beings due to its acidity. The additives make it more dangerous, especially breathing iron flakes, but it's nothing our medics can't deal with.\n"

"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) cartridge, fed by 5-round magazines which can weigh as much as one kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows quick repeated shots on semi-automatic without any loss of accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the LRWS is only effective out to approximately 1 kilometre -- barely a third of the range of a standard anti-materiel rifle -- but we estimate that PHALANX should never face a situation where this might become a problem. Its reduced accuracy is amended by a highly-advanced scope that will calculate and display intelligent bullet trajectories wherever the rifle is pointing.\n"
"\n"
"The integral 'smart' bipod features a pneumatic suspension system that keeps the barrel perfectly horizontal to allow accurate fire even on broken ground. The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any shooter. Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in Mumbai than any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
"\n"
"At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, the LWRS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require. This weapon will not disappoint.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification S-1.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Soldiers equipped with the S-1should keep their distance, fire from cover, and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic weapon; a missed shot wastes time, ammunition and possibly life.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

"We've achieved results in our effort to create anti-alien chemicals that can be effectively used on the battlefield. One agent in particular has been classified as fully combat-capable and is ready to be deployed at your say-so.\n"
"\n"
"The agent in question is a cocktail of bleach, mustard gas, titanium tetrachloride and several other nasty compounds, combining to form a substance we like to call \"CHOKE\". It is a highly powerful blistering agent that reacts with organic skin in seconds rather than hours. It reacts violently with air to provide several minutes of gas coverage over a small, concentrated area.\n"
"\n"
"The effects on organic tissue are harsh. Even minor contact with the skin or mucous membranes will cause severe irritation, resulting in restricted breathing and excruciating pain. Contact with the eyes can cause prolonged, even permanent blindness if left untreated. The agony caused by CHOKE is so acute and disabling that it will knock the fight out of almost anything with which it comes into contact. Our organic alien captives have all demonstrated very satisfying responses; most targets go into shock and exhibit little to no motor control until dosed up with painkillers and anti-CHOKE medication. Their breathing apparatus offers no defence whatsoever against an agent which doesn't need to enter the lungs.\n"
"\n"
"CHOKE is equally effective against humans. Volunteer testing has left battle-hardened soldiers hunched on the floor in a foetal position, frozen in place and barely able to breathe. Two subjects had to be rushed to hospital due to blistering of the lungs and fluid buildup, but I'm happy to report both will survive. It is however recommended that our troops be kept away from any deployed CHOKE at all times. If one of our troops does manage to come into contact with it, we've loaded our medikits with the appropriate drugs to treat and revive.\n"
"\n"
"The only defence against CHOKE is full body coverage. Any exposed skin or breathing passage is a vulnerability, and so far the aliens have deployed no armour that would protect their troops against this kind of attack. As far as PHALANX agents are concerned, a full head-enclosing gas mask should protect them adequately, since our standard uniforms and armours provide airtight coverage of the soldier's body.\n"

"We've finished prototyping our experimental electrical weapon, and it's now ready to begin full production.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of the stun rod, as we call it, requires no in-depth explanation. It's an electrical prod that delivers a stunning shock to anything that comes into contact with the prongs at the front of the weapon. The intensity of the shock can be easily set by the user; high-end shocks can temporarily overload the systems of alien robots and trigger a shutdown, but such powerful shocks delivered to organic enemies can be quite lethal. The stun rod is also more than capable of stunning or electrocuting any humans who get too close. Caution is recommended.\n"
"\n"
"The combat applications are simple. The soldier wielding it would enter into melee with an alien, bring the prongs into contact with the enemy's skin or armour, and pull the trigger. The ensuing electrical discharge would stun or disable the subject for some time, even through armour or protective skin. The period of unconsciousness will vary from species to species and between individuals, depending on their exposure, metabolism, mental state, and more. I'm afraid I cannot provide you with any hard numbers yet. However, we estimate the stun rod to give us more than enough time to secure the prisoner and render it harmless.\n"
"\n"
"We fully realise the difficulty of bringing the aliens to melee and then besting them. This is why we've armoured the stun rod's body to stand up against the Kerrblade without being sliced in two. It's designed to use as a staff or club in melee during an emergency, and it will not break, crack or become unreliable.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and additional armour, the stun rod has become a rather hefty weapon. It will require two hands to use effectively in combat as a prod or a blunt instrument, though it will not restrict grenade throwing or pistol use in the off hand.\n"
"\n"
"The outputs that the stun rod can deliver -- repeatedly -- make it the most powerful electrical weapon on Earth at this time. However, despite efforts to push our designs further, we don't yet have the technology to create ranged weapons that can match the stun rod's capabilities. Electrolasers are still too weak for their power consumption and wire-tasers can only be used once at limited ranges. We are however looking into adapting alien power cells for use in PHALANX-built electrolasers. This is a possibility that holds great promise for the future of our bio research.\n"
"\n"
"Thank you for your indulgence in this program, Commander. I firmly believe this will be a great help to our capture efforts. Still, I will try to leave further technical matters with Cdr. Navarre, where they belong.\n"

"I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds, but I have an important technical research proposal to make, a proposal to create a new piece of PHALANX equipment for use by our field agents. I realise this falls outside the responsibilities of my division. However, I've already discussed things with Cdr. Navarre, and he doesn't quite see eye-to-eye with me on the necessity of the item in question. I had no choice but to go to straight to you with the proposal.\n"
"\n"
"As you know, we've yet to capture an alien alive during our tactical engagements in all the weeks we've been waging this war. Now that we know how to keep them alive in containment, our lack of specimens is becoming a serious impediment to our biological and chemical research. We need living tissue to study, performing its natural functions inside a living body, and we don't have the ability to simply clone up some aliens to research. We need prisoners. The sooner the better.\n"
"\n"
"That's why I would like to propose a simple but high-powered electrical shock weapon, not unlike a military stun gun, designed to disable our enemies without killing them. It would be a two-handed man-portable unit with a large battery and several charge settings, the highest of which should be sufficient even to disable alien robots such as the Bloodspider. We in DivBio believe that any alien subjected to this weapon would be disabled long enough for our soldiers to take control of the situation and secure prisoners.\n"
"\n"
"Cdr. Navarre, however, feels that such a weapon would be hazardous to our soldiers and \"a throwback to the 20th century\", and refuses to endorse it. He doesn't seem to understand. We have no alternative method of disabling enemies at the voltages required. Commander, we need this weapon as badly as we need live aliens from the field. We can't merely shoot them and hope to patch one or two up again upon return to base. Even if we succeeded in that mindset, my division's needs will be far, far higher than that for proper research and interrogation.\n"
"\n"
"I hope you understand. Please authorise lab time and funding for this project as soon as you can, and I'll get some people from DivEngine together to develop this project properly.

"Particle-beam weaponry is designed to hit a target object with a stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore carrying tremendous kinetic energy. Until now we've only seen the aliens use this technology in large UFO weapons. Now, however, they're using it on the ground in the worst way.\n"
"\n"
"The pistol itself is quite simple in build, just a shell covering a set of magnets and electrostatic lenses for focusing and constricting the particle beam. This is all stuff we can duplicate easily with enough money and effort. However, we've yet to figure out the weapon's ammo supply. The energy readings we've taken from the magazines are extreme, and despite our efforts, we haven't managed to disable or disarm one in order to safely open it up. Even shooting it dry doesn't completely deactivate one of these magazines. More research will be required before we can try and understand them, much less reproduce them.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly this pistol is the nastiest handgun I've ever seen in my career, with impressive armour-piercing capabilities and extreme damage potential. The high-speed particle beam can kill a lightly-armoured human in one shot at ranges of up to 40 metres. Just one shot. With regards to lethality at range, it outperforms even our laser pistol. The only good news is that the PB pistol is significantly less accurate than our lasers and produce too much of a kick to make repeated accurate shots.\n"
"\n"
"In fact, firing the pistol may be difficult for troops with less than the required physical strength. The particles leaving the barrel move at a fraction of the speed of light, so they generate an unholy amount of recoil against the shooter. It would be an extreme challenge for weaker troops to keep the weapon on-target. If these pistols are deployed, we recommend they only be issued to the stronger troops on our squad.\n"

"This cannon has got to be the most powerful infantry particle beam the aliens can field, because I can't imagine them getting much bigger. Though smaller and lighter than the Plasma Blaster, the PB cannon's recoil is out of this world. It can blast a full grown man clean off his feet in one shot. No normal human will be able to use this weapon. We can adapt it for mounting on our UGVs, and we may be able to enhance our soldiers with cybernetic implants or powered armour, but that's all.\n"

"As bad as the recoil is, the target will have it worse. A single fleeting hit -- a heartbeat of exposure -- will buckle three inches of homogenous steel and blow the target back by several metres.

"What first alarmed me about this weapon is its performance against our infantry armour. The high-energy particles in a particle beam travel so fast that the beam can easily punch a hole through our standard vehicle armour. When fired at a suit of Combat Armour, the results are gruesome.

"Commander, my method worked. I think we've managed to crack the secrets of the mysterious particle beam weaponry. Here are my conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of man-portable particle beam weaponry suggests a serious escalation in this war. Prior to being shot at with it, we had no idea that the aliens possessed such advanced technology, and we have no idea why it was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy remain a complete mystery to us. Still, I don't believe I'm overstating the issue that these weapons change everything.\n"
"\n"
"When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting the particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my fist. I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the 'magazine', until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
"\n"
"Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator of mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so small that we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The synchrotron speeds particles round and round in a very small circle -- less than the diameter of the magazine -- until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the rest of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary to duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons works, and they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to use them we're going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, these little accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in their lifetimes, and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a few times. Our ammo supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we can recover in the field.\n"
"\n"
"If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of magnitude greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have more numbers and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in fits and starts. It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you that 'why' doesn't matter right now. They're the ones making the mistake and it's up to us to take advantage of it.\n"
"\n"
"We need to upgrade, upgun, and uptrain everything we have, Commander. Everything. We have to be ready before they start getting really serious about this war.\n"

"Commander, we've decided that more research is badly needed on the particle beam weaponry, especially their mysterious power source, the magazines which we've been utterly unable to examine. No amount of finesse or ingenuity has been able to open them. That's why I'm hereby proposing extreme measures.\n"
"\n"
"I want to use our lab's radiation chamber to bombard one of the magazines with electromagnetic pulses, destroying most of the internal electronics, and hopefully causing it to shut down. Once it's safely deactivated, we can use brute force to open it up.\n"
"\n"
"Destroying a magazine to find out how it works may seem crude and backwards, but we have no other choice at the moment. Even blasted to hell by EMP, it should help us answer a lot of questions about the aliens' particle beam technology. It may also give us clues as to how we can get inside an undamaged magazine.\n"

Every attempt at producing artificial spider silk had failed, but researchers at the PHALANX Pacific Operations Command base finally managed it in 2017.

"The first widespread use of military combat armour made from spider silk came as a joint effort by NATO in 2023, after ballistic tests proved that Chinese rounds tore right through their aging standard-issue kevlar vests.

The resulting fabric is about 18 times stronger than steel and provides a performance increase over kevlar that is estimated between 300 and 400%. Suits made primarily from polyethylene became obsolete after artificial spider silk was released into the wider market, and the new composite armour soon replaced it in military use throughout the world. The armour has been upgraded to move with the times, being so effective that it is still in common use today. It features pockets on the front and back that can take ceramic or metal inserts to further protect vital areas.\n"
"\n"
"Den första utbredda användningen av militära rustningar gjorda av spindelsiden kom från en förenad insats av NATO år 2023, efter att testskjutningar visat att kinesisk ammunition skör rakt igenom deras standardkevlarvästar. Rustningen i sig är gjord av flera lager spindelsilke och behandlat hög molekylärviktspolyeten, vilket ger en otrolig styrka och flexibilitet. Materialet är runt 18 gånger starkare än stål och medför en förbättring gämfört med kevlar på mellan 300 och 400%. Dräkter gjorda av endast polyeten blev omoderna när spindelsilke blev vanligt på marknaden, och den nya kompositrusningen ersatte snart den inom militärt bruk över hela världen. Rustningen har följd med tiden, och forsatt utvecklats så att den är modern än i dag. Den har fickor på fram- och baksidan där keramiska peller metallplattor kan användas för att ytterligare skydda vitala områden.\n"
"\n"
"The Combat Armour's only disadvantage is its relatively high weight compared to older suits, but this is mainly due to the number of layers required to properly protect against modern weapons. The weight is evenly distributed, making it quite comfortable to wear and much less bulky than experimental nanocomposite armours. This armour will save lives while preserving the soldier's all-important mobility.\n"
"\n"
"Krigsrustningens enda nackdel är dens relativt höga vikt i jämförelse med äldre dräkter, men det beror främst på det nummer av lager som krävs för att skydda mot moderna vapen. Vikten är jämnt fördelad vilket gör den bekväm att bära och betydligt mer rörlig än tidigare experimentella nanokompisitrustningar. Den här dräkten räddar liv samtidigt som den bevarar soldatens livsviktiga mobilitet.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Rekommenderad användning\n"
"\n"
"Närhelst möjligt bör PHALANX-trupper alltid bära rustning när de sänds in i en stridssituation. Krigsrustningen skall alltid anses som det grundläggande skydd ingen soldat har råd att klara sig utan. För vissa soldater kommer krigsrustningen finnas som valbart alternativ till tyngre, mer avancerade rustningar p.g.a. den rörlighet den tillhandahåller. Krypskyttar och samtliga som inte förväntas befinna sig på frontlinjen kommer ha stor nytta av den extra mobiliteten.\n"

"Commander, I would like to report the success of our nanocomposite production research!\n"
"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes into a latticework pattern. We've been able to create a prototype furnace of our own, and have made various modifications to our nanotube production methods based on the alien examples. The result is a significant increase in power efficiency and production volume.\n"
"\n"
"From here on I'll restrict my summary to the capabilities and tactical applications of the new armour, which I trust you will find both fascinating and encouraging.\n"
"\n"
"We've managed to duplicate almost all the functionality of the alien armour, from the nanocomposite plates to the servo-assisted movement. It is incredibly light for its bulk, though still considerably heavier than our Combat Armour. It is almost as protective as the alien model, and bestows similar quickness of movement and more precise aiming.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact is that the aliens have a good deal more experience with these materials and can work them a lot more elegantly than we can. Our armour is bulkier and heavier, more stiffly-constructed, and its electronics do not perform as well. This may negatively impact firing speed and reaction time. Our version of the polymer isn't quite as good as theirs, it tends to crack more easily. Our servomotors in particular are large and unwieldy compared to the compact alien designs. There's no way to reduce their size any further than we already have.\n"
"\n"
"We're really quite embarrassed about the boots in particular, but they are honestly the best we could do. We simply don't have the precision machinery needed to make servos like the aliens do. Regardless, we've tried our best to make the boots safe and light, with a powerful suspension system in the soles to make them springy enough for rapid movement.\n"
"\n"
"The new armour's tactical applications are extensive. It's light enough to be worn by forward elements of our tac teams, yet protective enough to resist heavy weapons fire. It will serve exceptionally well for close assault troops that need both speed and armour to perform their best.\n"

"Our examination of the alien body armour has led us to many interesting realisations. Obviously, the key to creating more effective mobile armour based on the alien suits lies in the direction of nanocomposites. This will require large amounts of carbon nanotubes.\n"

"In the past, carbon nanotubes have been difficult and expensive to produce, and trying to work them into a proper shape was even worse. Because of this nanocomposite armour has never been used except in high-cost vehicles such as aircraft and tanks, and then only in plating that requires minimal shaping or other work. The alien armour, however, uses carbon nanotube composites in abundance. It's our manufacturing processes that are holding us back.\n"

"Commander, we've got a full report on the alien armour for you.\n"
"\n"
"It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of a composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In fact, the most important element is something with which humanity is already well-acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known as CNTs or 'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are incredibly strong, one of the strongest materials known to humankind. They have been relatively little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs very well against plasma as well as against ordinary bullets, lasers and explosives. However ironically, it's not very effective against incendiary devices or flamethrowers, since these weapons also raise the atmospheric temperature around the wearer. In this scenario the armour is left with no place to effectively dump its heat and will not protect the wearer as he roasts inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour using the alien suit as a template. It will be in your inbox presently, Commander.\n"

"Where armour is concerned, the aliens' design philosophy seems to be, \"If it works, let's use more of it.\" This new armour is similar in design to the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises and delicate balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the torso and head, the medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with much more dense nanopolymer plates, including major arteries and sensitive nerve clusters. In comparison with the alien body armour, the medium suit has double the number of nanotube strands per square centimetre. As a result these plates are nearly impenetrable to standard human firearms and even the softer mesh covering the joints can stop bullets with disturbing ease.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned before, the suit strongly emphasises protection over mobility. The large trauma plates get in the wearer's way no matter what race or size he might be, and the dense nanotube polymers used are so heavy that the overall weight will slow down even an Ortnok. There are numerous mini-servos and other mechanical parts that help deal with some of the weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are integrated into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite interesting and we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as weapon enhancements.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against humanity in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance against lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the Alien Body Armour, though it's still somewhat vulnerable to particle beams. Aliens wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from crossing open flame or brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged exposure will still overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
"\n"
"In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its full effect.\n"
"\n"
"The alien suits won't fit our troops without modifications that would critically weaken them. We've taken a few stabs at replicating the dense nanopolymers, but our Workshop machinery is currently unable to weave so many nanotubes at once. I have a few ideas about how to upgrade it, though, as well as some designs for a new armour to take advantage of those upgrades. The proposal should be in your queue now, Commander.\n"

"\n"
"Översikt\n"
"\n"
"Prioritet nummer ett för Utomjordiska Beredskaps Enheten är att bereda sig inför en tid när det kommer att behövas. PHALANX Förvarings facilitet är en viktig del av vilken beredskaps plan som helst. Dem innehåller atmosfäriska boendekammare, förhörsmaskiner, näringsdistributions enheter, och alla andra apparater som behövs för att upprätthålla utomjordiskt liv som vi kan komma över.\n"
"\n"
"För det första, dom lufttäta boendekammrarna förser en plats att lagra och förvara utomjordingar för en betydande tidsperiod. Deras atmosfär generatorer är kapabla att pumpa varje individuell kammare med önskad gasblandning. Detta förser en utomjording med andningsbar luft för åtminståne flera veckor, allafall långt ifrån den förväntade livslängden för en art i vårt forskningsprogram. Spårelement som inte finns naturligt på jorden kan bli svåra att få tag på men sannolikheten att detta ska bli ett hinder för vår forskning är oändligt liten. Värsta som kan hända är att atmosfärs generatorerna är konstruerade att tillåta länkar till bärgad livsuppehållande utrustning.\n"
"\n"
"För det andra, waldo-drivna medicinsk och förhörs apparater finns i varje boendekammare som klarar av att ge lugnande medicin eller andra kemiska injektioner via ett trycklufts pilgevär eller att tillämpa elchocker för förhörssyften. Det finns en s.k. \"panik knapp\" installerad på varje kammare och en i kontrollrummet för varje sektion av kammare. Panik knappen kan omedelbart bränna allt innehåll av kammaren vid ett nödfall.\n"
"\n"
"Kammarna och korridorerna av Förvaringsfaciliteten är speciellt konstruerad att tillåta utomjordingar i vilken storlek och form som helst att bli transporterade och förvarade. Faciliteten har också ett fullt utrustat cryo-bårhus för att lagra lik och prover för en senare granskning.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Rekommenderad Doktrin\n"
"\n"
"Vid en invasion så borde förvaringsenheten användas så mycket det bara går för att lagra både levande och döda utomjordingar för forskning och tillåta oss att undersöka dom i levande tillstånd. Det finns inget viktigare än upptäckten av tankeprocessen av det utomjordiska psyket för att lära oss om deras motivation och kanske komma på en kompromiss, en chans för kommunikation, eller en passande motstrategi för att neutralisera fienden en gång för alla.\n"
"\n"
"Om en PHALANX bas skulle bli attackerad så borde man överväga att trycka på panik knappen på hela Förvaringsfaciliteten omedelbart. Om inte det finns oersättliga arter i förvaring, vi kan inte riskera att attackerande utomjordingar fritar deras fångade kamrater. Omedelbar och total sövning är en annan mer riskabel strategi -- men jag betonar att man vinner inga krig med halvmesyrer.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Tillägg\n"
"\n"
"Till en eventuell framtida Kommendör som kommer att granska denna fil:\n"
"\n"
"Kom ihåg att maskinerna i Förvaringsfaciliteten som mycket av PHALANX utrustning för övrigt, har inte genomgått riktiga tester mot utomjordiska styrkor. Uppgraderingar eller finjusteringar kan behövas för att fungera enligt konstruktions specifikationerna."

"Till någon förnäm prominent person som läser denna rapport -- Jo, visst -- Jag borde varna dig att jag är en aning berusad och diktaterar det sista pappersarbetet innan basen stängs ner för alltid. Och jag har antagligen varit död länge innan någon gräver upp någon information om detta gamla projekt så jag kan inte få något trubbel för vad jag än säjer här. För protokollet, den förbannade försvarsministern kan bli uppkapad med en motorsåg. 'Budget nedskärningar'. Jooo säkert.\n"
"\n"
"I allafall vi gjorde några uppgraderingar på KC nyligen så jag måste skicka en ny rapport.\n"
"\n"
"Kommandocentralen är nervcentralen av en PHALANX bas. Den koordinerar all aktivitet i basen från forskning till ingenjörsarbete, den samlar in och tolkar datan från våra radar installationer, den tjänar som ett krigsrum för uppdragsplanering och den är K3 (Kommando/Kontroll/Kommunikation) nav som skickar iväg och vägleder våra luftangrepp. En bas kan operera utan en fungerande Kommandocentral men den blir blind, döv och dum; våra jagare kan inte ens skickas iväg utan trafikövervakning.\n"
"\n"
"Kommandocentralen är packat från golv till tak med en helt ny H-9000 stordator och en spjutspets kommunikations utrustning, som håller på att bli utrivet av ett gäng ligister med slagborrsmaskiner medans jag skriver detta. Denna utrustning kan inte fungera utan ett kraftverk för att förse den tillräckligt med el.\n"
"\n"
"En röna, de flesta av kommandostaben faktiskt bor i KC men jag har hört att personer med lägre rang har sett deras kojer ibland. Men pratar för mig själv dock, som bäst är det anekdot bevis.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Rekommenderad Doktrin\n"
"\n"
"Vid den osannolika händelsen att denna typ av installation skulle någonsin byggas igen, se till att den har tillräckligt med elkraft för att driva den ordentligt och placera den på en välbevakad plats med ett bra avstånd från Ingången och Hangarerna. Om basen blir attackerad så är försvaret av KC av högsta prioritet för utan den så blir vi oförmögna att ge dem en effektiv strid tills den kan bli reparerad.\n"

"Tillägg, Befälhavare Abel S. Howard, 18 Mars 2084:\n"
"\n"
"De gamla KC blåkopiorna har blivit uppdaterade av våra ingenjörer för att byta ut den uråldriga H-9000 stordatorn och terminaler med moderna holograf-arbetsstationer och en ny superdators installation. Alla andra komponenter är användbara och effektiva."

"Basens ingång är den första byggnad som byggs på alla nya PHALANX platser. Det är det primära -- och ibland det enda -- sätt för utrustning och personal att komma in i basen.\n"
"\n"
"Den består av en fordonsramp och ett trapphus som tillåter enkel förflyttning mellan basen och ytan. En liten kamouflerad grindstuga är byggt på ytan för säkerhet och kommer också att skydda ingången från överflygningar. Likt alla våra ytinstallationer, så är den övertäckt med radar- och infraröd-absorberings färg för att minska chansen för upptäckt.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Rekommenderad Doktrin\n"
"\n"
"Av sin natur så är Ingången en av de sårbaraste byggnaderna i varje bas. Fientliga utomjordingar kommer med all säkerhet försöka ta sig in här. Det är en av centralpunkterna för försvaret av en bas och borde placeras med en tilltänkt distans från Kommando Centralen så att tjänstgörande befäl kan hinna svara på en attack med yttersta iver utan att riskera KC.\n"
"\n"
"I sig självt har ingången litet taktiskt värde. Det kan antas att utomjordingarna kommer endast försöka hålla Ingången och välja mer frestande mål att angripa, då Ingången inte innehåller någonting flyktigt och har inga områden som är särskilt känsligt för förstörelse. Det finns ingen avancerad utrustning eller komponenter och den är också lätt att reparera. Om den skadas så finns det andra byggnader som temporärt kan ta över Ingångens funktioner utan att hämma basens operationer.\n"

"Av: Kommendör Paul Navarre, Forskning och utveckling: Utvecklingsavdelningen, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Överblick\n"
"\n"
"Missiler har blivit mer och mer kraftfulla sen andra världskriget, medans motmedelsteknologier bara har blivit effektiva sedan början av 2000 talet. I en tävling mellan angrepp och försvar, angriparna ha alltid haft övertaget. Men detta har inte avskräckt utomjordingarna från att utveckla försvar som vi blir alldels stumma av häpnad av.\n"
"\n"
"Som ett exempel, GEU styrkor har skjutit mot utomjordiska farkoster med SAM: s (Surface-to-Air Missiles eller 'Mark-till-luft missiler') skickade från batterier runt om i Europa medans de hade en radarlåsning på två av de utomjordiska farkosterna. Senare, i närheten så öppnade infanterienheter eld, med mellan tolv och femton portabla anti-flygplans vapen.\n"
"\n"
"Antalet träffar? En. Bara en. UFO: t fick bara något mindre hastighet under landningen vid Bonn och kunde sen starta den igen utan problem.\n"
"\n"
"Slutsatsen är tydlig: utomjordisk EK (Elektronisk Krigsföring) förmåga är vida mer avancerad än vår egen. Men vi på PHALANX har gjort en noggrann studie av den enda träffen och det var inte en lyckoträff. Vad som hände var att UFO: t blottade sig själv vid en viss vinkel på ett sätt att den fick mindre smygandeförmåga ('stealth') medans den duckade undan andra explosiva krigsmateriel, som tillät missilen att vara låst hela vägen till sitt mål.\n"
"\n"
"Detta bevisar att de utomjordingarna inte är osårbara för våra missiler. Vi behöver bara det bästa möjliga missilerna för det jobbet. Dessa realiseringar har sett till att anpassa några gamla missilbatteri ritningar och utrusta dom med helt nya ramper. Våra resultat är lovande.\n"
"\n"
"Batteriet består av 4 ramper som 'poppar upp' till ytan när den ska angripa ett mål. Varje ramp bär 20 st av AA51 \"Cicada\" SAM. Detta är den mest avancerade missilen på jorden, med mer elektronik än ett passargerarplan, konstruerad att skjuta ner fiende farkoster från skyn oavsett hur fort dom går. Det finns inget bättre försvarssystem på planeten när detta skrivs.\n"
"\n"
"Mot utomjordiska farkoster så är 'Cicadans' chanser att träffa fortfarande låg men med ett stort antal så kommer de bli skadade. Missilen och dess elektonik är naturligtvis mycket dyr, långt för mycket för våran budget för det antal som kommer att krävas för att besegra inkommande UFO: s. Lyckligtvis så har FN gått med på att förse oss med standard SAM missiler från deras egna strategiska reserver till ingen kostnad.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Rekommenderad Doktrin\n"
"\n"
"Om denna byggs på någon av våra baser så kan batteriet programeras att skjuta på vilket UFO som helst inom räckvidden eller vänta tills ett UFO identifieras att attackera basen. Detta beslut är upp till Baskommendören. Assistera våra jagare genom att 'mjuka upp' ett UFO med SAM missiler kommer att hjälpa att ta bort lite press från våra piloter och flygfarkoster, men det finns inget sätt att helt gömmma våra missilbatterier trots våra bästa försök till att kamouflera dom. Återkommande storskaliga avfyrningar kommer att visa var vår position är för eller senare.\n"
"\n"
"Missilbatteriet kommer att vara under medelfara under ett basangrepp. Den är konstruerad att förhindra ett basangrepp; om någon väl kommit förbi så borde det inte vara några problem för angriparna om de inte ska bana vägen för en styrka till. Det kan vara ett mål om en chans uppstår, våra missiler är välbevakade men kommer detonera om de utsätts för tillräckligt våld. En explosion i missilbatteriet kan ha katastrofala följder på basen i stort.\n"

VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing eller 'Vertikal Start och Landning') krav på alla nya PHALANX flygfarkoster har eliminerat behovet av landningsbanor. Detta har gjort så att vi kan placera alla Hangarer i basen för att öka säkerheten och minska utrycknings tiderna.\n"
"\n"
"Den Stora Hangaren förser underjordisk plats för att förvara och underhålla 1 stor VTOL flygfarkost. Reparationer, laddning av ammunition och tankning kan utföras i fullständig skymundan. Flygfarkosten ser inte ens dagsljus tills det är dax för start. Under en start så fälls taket undan och en hydraulisk hiss lyfter farkosten till en position ovanför taket för en säker start.\n"
"\n"
"För landningsproceduren så har hissen flera långa fångstkrokar som -- väl fastkrokade på undersidan av en hovrande pilot -- sänker den försiktigt farkosten till en landning. Fångstkrokarna kan automatiskt justera deras grepp och t.o.m. byta grepp från krok till krok för att få farkosten till den rätta landnings positionen. När fångskrokarna har snärjat undersidan och dragit ner den till landningsytan så behöver bara piloten dra av på gasen. Systemet är enkelt att använda när piloten får kläm på det.\n"
"\n"
"Ett nästan identiskt system har blivit genomfört i Liten Hangar.\n"

"\n"
"Varje PHALANX flygfarkost kräver 1 hangar av lämplig storlek för lagring, underhållning och utnyttjande.\n"

"Hangarer är en särskild sårbar installation pga deras direktkontakt med ytan. De kommer att vara den primära målet för att komma in i basen för en utomjordiska angriparna. Det är en extrem skaderisk, fylld med flyktiga vätskor som jetbränsle och möjligen högexplosiv farkostammunition. Värre är att varje flygfarkost som är kvar i basen kommer att vara ett mycket frestande mål; svår skadegörelse på våra jagare -- eller mer skrämmande, våra landningsskepp -- kommer att stänga ner vår stridsoduglighet i flera veckor.\n"
"\n"
"Om möjligt så ska alla farkoster skickas ut innan ett överhängande basangrepp och förflyttas från området tills angreppet är över. Dom kan bli angripna av ett inflygande UFO, men åtminstånde ha övertaget av att kunna manövrera. Men detta är inte alltid den mest användbara taktiken. Att skicka ut våra farkoster inom räckvidden av tungt beväpnade attackskepp kan ha mer katastrofala resultat än att låta dom vara kvar i hangarerna, som de frestande mål de är.\n"

"Den här konflikten kommer att bli blodig Kommendör. För att kunna behandla de svårt skadade på slagfältet som vi kommer att se, så behöver vi avancerade faciliteter med utrustning inget civilt eller militärt standard sjukhus har tillgängligt. Detta är helt klart; hundratals dog onödigt i Mumbais sjukhus för att de inte hade den utrustning som behövdes för att behandla de rysliga bendjupa plasma brännskadorna som gjordes av utomjordingarnas vapen. Vi måste vara bättre förberedda än så.\n"
"\n"
"De gamala PHALANX sjukhus konstruktionerna var bedrövligt bristfälliga för att klara av den kommande stormen. De har inte blivit uppdaterade sen de byggdes vid 1960 och innehöll lite till inget ändamålsenlig-designad utrustning. I slutändan så måste vi byta ut dom helt med nya ritningar skapade av mig, med hjälp av Kommendör Navarre och våra byggnadsexperter. Hur den tidigare ledningen förväntades att klara av stridsskador från okänd utomjordiska vapen kommer jag aldrig få veta.\n"
"\n"
"Som det är nu så är våra sjukhus de finaste i världen. Vi är ledande experterna i att behandla brännskador, speciellt att ta bort och regenerera förkolnad vävnad. Vi tillskyndar skadat kött att regenerera genom intensiv terapi som inkluderar en lång kur av mediciner, elektronisk stimulation på nerver och muskler och införsel av nanorobotar direkt in i såret.Teoretiskt så borde vi kunna restaurera alla levande mänskliga varelser till ursprungligt skick inom sex veckor. Detta inkluderar psykologisk utvärdering och skade rådgivning. Lättare skador kommer naturligtvis ta kortare tid att läka.\n"
"\n"
"Vi har också faciliteter för att genomföra amputation och större bioteknik operationer. Kraftfulla cybernetiska lemmar har blivit tillgängliga av vår militärs källor runt om på jorden tillika bepansrade bröstkorgar, elektroniska ögon och annan invändigt maskineri. Dessa kan bli installerade i våra soldater på sjukhuset för att förbättra deras stridseffektivitet om vi har råd med de höga kostnaderna och tiden för tillfrisknandet.\n"
"\n"
"Sjukhuset behöver ett Kraftverk för att förse den höga och kontinuerliga elförbrukning den behöver.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Rekommenderad Doktrin\n"
"\n"
"Varje bas med en beväpnade utryckningsenheter borde ha ett Sjukhus för behandlingar. Om det inte finns någon PHALANX Sjukhus tillgängligt kommer soldater att skickas till civila sjukhus där inte en optimal behandling kan resultera i en permanent minskning i förmåga eller t.o.m. död.\n"
"\n"
"Fördelarna att förbättra våra soldater med mekaniska delar borde vara uppenbart. Dessa procedurer kan bara utföras på en helt frisk kropp; tillfrisknade trupper som har fått fysiska skador nyligen eller opererats måste tillfriskna helt innan dom kan komma på fråga för biotekniska uppgraderingar. Kom ihåg att den biotekniska lem eller ögon bytet kan få negativa effekter på patientens moral.\n"
"\n"
"Taktiskt så är Sjukhuset ett medel hotat område. Utomjordingarna kanske kommer försöka döda våra skadade beröva oss av en riktig medicinsk facilitet, men det är relativt osannolikt att angriparna skulle välja Sjukhuset som sitt primära mål. Men om vi blir attackerade så ska en vakt posteras vid sjukhuset så fort så möjligt.\n"

"Det finns skäl varför PHALANX labben anses de bästa i USA under de senaste 50 åren. Vi uppfann flygplanens 'Stealth' teknologi på 60-talet med XD4 stealth jagaren och har förblivit vid framkanten med den första produktionen av artificiell spindelväv för fyra år sedan. Det är resultaten från en blandning av de smartaste människorna med den bästa utrustningen som finns att få tag på. Att hålla oss i framkanten säkrar vår beredskap mot ett möjligt utomjordiskt hot.\n"
"\n"
"Våra nya laboratorium är utrustade för all sorts forskning; bioteknik, nanoteknik, högenergi lasrar, partikel fysik och mycket mer. Det finns inget som inte får plats inom laboratoriets väggar som inte kan bli ordentligt studerat, dissekerat eller nedplockat. Som standard finns det tankar som kan producera vilken organisk materia som vi kan komma att behöva, hologram projektorer för tester och simulationer, laser och maser installationer, en förminskad tokomak fusionskammare för plasma forskning och en kraftfull partikel accelerator.\n"

"Så länge vi får den finansiering vi behöver så kommer laboratoriet vara en av de viktigaste delarna i vår försvars strategi.För att vi ska kunna besegra någon fiende så måste vi först känna till så mycket vi kan, och kanske t.o.m. förstå honom. För att lyckas med det så behöver vi den bästa forsknings installationen mänskligheten kan bygga, och vår är det.\n"

"Under en tänkbar attack så är de ett medel prioriterat mål. Om de angripande utomjordingarna är nog medvetna om vår existens för att attackera våra baser direkt så kommer dom med all säkerhet vilja stänga ner vårt forsknings program. Det finns lättare mål som kan hota hela basens överlevnad -- speciellt Kraftverket -- men om dom får ett tillfälle så kommer utomjordingarna ta sig tid att rigga sprängämnen inuti labbet, som är fullt med våldsamma ämnen. Basen skulle kunna få stora skador om inte våra labb skyddas tillräckligt.\n"

"PHALANX har haft problem att generera tillräckligt med energi för vad basen behöver ända sen organisationen först skapades 1955. De gamla baserna var tvungna att pumpa in elekticitet från stora ej utsändande källor (som hydroelektriska dammar) via många kilometer av kabel. De var helt beroende av utomstående elkraft och blev paralyserade när elnätet slocknade. Det har tagit den Ryska kärkrafts revolutionen för att göra det möjligt till full elektrisk självständighet på våra underjordiska baser, även när factoring hög-energi forskning. Vårat val av kraftverk är den Tyska HERF (Hög-Energi Fusions Reaktorn), en väldigt effektiv energi förstärkande konstruktion. Det är en underkritisk reaktor, en reaktor som producerar fusion utan att klara av en bibehållen kedjereaktion. Istället använder den en utomstående källa av neutroner -- i detta fall en partikel accelerator -- för att stimulera en reaktion. Denna metod frigör tillräckligt med kraft för att behålla partikel acceleratorn igång och ett kraftöverskott som vidarebefordras till resten av basen.\n"
"\n"
"HERF drivs med torium istället för uran och det mesta av avfallet kommer att brytas ned naturligt till den radioaktiva nivån av kolaska på bara 500 år. Som en jämförelse, de nedbrytningstider av isotoperna som är mest använda i atomvapen och gamla reaktorer är 24,110 år för plutonium (Pu-239) och 700 miljoner är för uran (U-235). Det korta-nedbrytbara avfallet är särskilt lätt att ta omhand om, då de förbrukade grundämnets avfallshanterings process är inbyggt i konstruktionen. Efter en behandling genom avfallshanterings processen Så kommer HERF: ens reaktorsavfall bara ta veckor att brytas ned till säkra nivåer av radiaktivitet för en människa.\n"
"\n"
"I vår konstruktion så är reaktor kärnan och driftsmaskineriet byggt inne i ett speciellt skal, placerat långt djupare än resten av basen. Bara kyltankarna och kontroll/service ingångarna når upp till basnivån. Detta skyddar mot den möjliga men minimala risken av en härdsmälta om vi helt förlorar kylning av kärnan.\n"
"\n"
"Jag erkänner, jag kopierade hälften av specifikationerna ord för ord från de olika referat jag har läst -- kärnkrafts fysik är lite över mitt huvud -- men jag förstår statestiken bra nog. Elkraften från ett kraftverk är nog för att helt klara de behov en standard bas har. Om en bas är utrustad med många hög-energi byggnader som laboratorier, så kan ett till kraftverk vara nödvändigt men en påföljande ökning av basförsvar och säkerhet kommer att behövas för att fskydda det ordentligt. Vi kan enkelt och säkert lagra tillräckligt med bränsle på plats för ett årtionde av fortsatt verksamhet. En skyddad behållare är installerad på varje reaktor som kan bli återfylld vid behov.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Rekommenderad Doktrin\n"
"\n"
"Varje bas behöver minst ett Kraftverk. Utan ett kraftverk så kan inte många faciliteter -- inklusive Kommandocentralen -- fungera. Baser med enorm elförbrukning måste kanske ha två eller fler för att behålla alla faciliteter på topp nivå.\n"
"\n"
"Våran basförsvars strategi borde få särskild uppmärksamhet för att försvara Kraftverket. Skador på kyltankarna kan bli katastrofalt; om vi förlorar för mycket kylvätska så blir en härdsmälta svårt att undvika. Vi borde beakta att stänga av reaktorn vid en förkommande attack, men det kommer ta lång tid att starta upp den igen, som under attacken inte kommer kunna ha igång någon energi förbrukande utrustning. Saker som radar, laboratorie utrustning och även hangar hissar.\n"

"\n"
"Vår Radar facilitet är inte en radar i sig utan ett kontrollcenter för en rad av kamoflerade paraboler plaserade på höjder runt basen. Det är mellan 8 och 12 paraboler för vaje installation beroende på tillgänglig plats och parabolens individuella täckning. Varje parabol är utrustad men flera tillämningar för detektion istället för en enkel radar, som en radar har den problem att hålla låsning på utomjordiska kontakter. Supplementära system ingår men är inte begränsad till infraröd- och laser avståndssökning.\n"
"\n"
"Att bygga fler än en radar installation kommer att öka utsträckningen på vår radar täckning.\n"
"\n"
"Faciliteten är bemannad dygnet runt i 6-timmars skift, som granskar insamlade data efter våra datorer som har sammlat in all märkbar information från en kontakt. Mänskliga operatör är absolut nödvändig och borde alltid vara närvarande för att övervaka; vad datorerna kanske avfärdar som ett radar spöke kan vara en smygande ('stealth') utomjordisk Skördare som är redo att attackera en folkhop av civila. Instinkter och erfarenhet räknas lika mycket som en programvaras underrättelser.\n"
"\n"
"Vår radar är ihop kopplad direkt till FN farkostregister och kan göra en korsreferens av transponder datan av vilket civil farkost som helst med sin flygrutt och lastmanifest. Icke-PHALANX militära farkoster kräver också att logga deras rutter in i våran databas men vi kan inte veta säkert om de olika nationernas styrkor kommer att sköta att följa det direktivet.\n"

"Radar faciliteten kan inte fungera utan ett fungerande Kraftverk eller en Kommandocentral för att koordinera våran radar i våra taktiska insatser.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Rekommenderad Doktrin\n"
"\n"
"Sen våra radar-sändande paraboler inte är vid våran bas så är det inte ett direkt hot av en upptäckt för en bas att använda aktiv radar.

"Men ett UFO som ses patrullera området kan komma att försöka att hitta våran installation och borde inte få möjligheten att slutföra sitt uppdrag under några omständigheter.\n"
"\n"
"Under en attack så kommer Radarn att vara i farozonen. Det är våra ögon och öron. Utan en fungerande radartäckning så skulle vi inte kunna se UFO: n vi ska göra utryckning mot. Om attackerande utomjordingar närmar sig faciliteten så kommer dom med all säkerhet att försöka skada eller förstöra den med sprängmedel. Vi får inte låta det hända.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, so I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
"\n"
"Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each installation, depending on the available space and the dishes' individual coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather than simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien contacts. Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared and laser rangefinding.\n"
"\n"
"Building more than one Radar installation at a base will suitably increase the extent of our radar coverage.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the processed data after our computers have gathered all discernible information from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and should be present to supervise at all times; what the computers might dismiss as a radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester ready to hit a mass off civilians. Instinct and experience count just as much as software intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight plan and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required to log their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if the various militaries will be very conscientious in following that directive.\n"
"\n"
"The Radar facility cannot function without a working Power Plant or a Command Centre to coordinate our radar into our tactical efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there is no direct threat of discovery to a base from using active radar. Considering the number of other military radar sources around, it's unlikely that alien craft will be able to learn anything from a dedicated backtrace. At most they'll be able to find the general area of a base.\n"
"\n"
"However, any UFOs spotted patrolling the area may be trying to zero in on our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission under any circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes and ears. Without working radar coverage, we wouldn't be able to see the UFOs we're supposed to respond to. If any attacking aliens approach the facility they will almost certainly attempt to damage or destroy it with explosives. We must not let that happen.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"We should not consider the Radar facility to be an end-all solution to UFO detection. Even with supplemental systems our coverage is not fully reliable, and we should research ways to improve our detection technology if we're to have any chance of stopping the bastards."

Det fungerar även som garage för våra stridsfordon. Dessa stannar i sina bås tills de ska ut på uppdrag, fullt laddade ifall basen skulle bli attackerad.\n"
"\n"
"Kameror och annan övervakning ser till att inte otillåtet uttag av material görs. Alla uttag måste godkännas av tjänstgörande officer innan alarmet stängs av. Skarp ammunition och annan känslig utrustning som utomjordiska artefakter förvaras i låsta behållare i intendentens kontor under sträng bevakning; för att ta ut något ur dessa behållare krävs att basens intendent är närvarande och en skriftlig order från Kommandocentralen.\n"

"All utrustnings rekvisition nödvändig för forskning, produktion och flygplans underhåll handhas av lämplig officer; ingen order från baskommendören behövs. Bara uppdrags utrustning och stridsfordon kräver kommendörens direkta tillsyn.\n"

"Lagret kan maximalt rymma 50 standard pallar av utrustning. Mängden av saker på pallen är ganska oviktigt, storlek är den största begränsande faktor med hänsyn till Lager byggnadens storlek. Innehållet på varje pall är noggrant märkt med magnetiska etiketter och detaljerade hålkorts loggar.\n"

Bärgnings operationer tas hand om FN styrkor för att lindra på trycket på våra begränsade resurser.\n"

"Den Stora UFO-hangaren kan lagra 1 utomjordiskt farkost av betydande storlek. Vi kommer att bedömma storleken av varje UFO typ när vi träffar på dom och bestämma vilken hangar som behövs för att förvara dem.\n"
"\n"
"Den Stora UFO-hangaren behöver ett Kraftverk för att förse de högförbrukande maskinerna och plasmabaserade skärverktygen med el. Den kräver också en Verkstad och Lager för att klara av demonteringen.\n"

"Alla bärgade UFO: s borde permanent försättas i obrukbart skick när de levereras. Skulle basen bli attackerad från utomjordiska styrkor, så kan vi inte ha råd med den extra risk att förvarade UFO: n skulle bli aktiverade och använda mot oss. Om någon farkosts vapensystem skulle vara aktivt, även utan ett drivsystem, skulle det vara ett stort hot mot våran bas.\n"
"\n"
"Om denna procedur följs så skulle UFO-hangarer vare av ett mindre taktiskt värde till de utomjordiska angriparna och kommer mest sannolikt bli ignorerad förutom om de inte råkade springa förbi. Hindra oss från att ta isär UFO: n skulle vara bra mycket mindre attraktivt än att stänga ner våran forskning eller produktion, eller förstöra vår bas helt och hållet.\n"
"\n"
"Vi kommer mest sannolikt behöva flera stycken av dessa installationer för att plocka ned och/eller undersöka flera UFON på en gång. Men vi kan ta bort en farkost från våra hangarer och förstöra den för att få plats med en ny om det skulle behövas. I detta scenario så skulle alla delar som skickats till Lagret vara tillgängliga men allt annat som inte tagits bort från UFO: t kommer bli förstörda.\n"

"PHALANX Verkstad är en småskalig produktionslinje utrustad med den mest högteknologiska militäriska tillverkningsprocess som finns tillgänglig. Den är konstruerad för en produktion av hemliga material och delar som ingen annan facilitet på jorden klarar av; även kopiering av utomjordisk teknologi.\n"
"\n"
"Alla delar som är producerade av verkstaden är handgjorda med så mycket hjälp från robotar som möjligt. Det kräver de mest kunniga ingenjörer i världen för att sköta de avancerade maskinerna och för att installera nya maskiner när våra forskare tänkt ut en ny eller förbättrad produktions process. Verkstaden tillhandahåller yta för upp till 10 ingenjörer.\n"
"\n"
"Ett Kraftverk krävs för att hålla produktionen igång. Utan ett fungerande kraftverk så måste produktionen avstanna tills elkraften är lagad. Verkstaden är också beroende av en Kommandocentral för att koordinera alla konstruktions insatser.\n"

"Rekommenderad Doktrin\n"
"\n"
"Vid ett möjligt utomjordiskt krig så kommer vi vara väldigt beroende av Verkstaden för att tillverka de vapen vi behöver. H.G. Wells, Världarnas krig, tänker man på för dess skrämande beskrivning av hur våran nuvarande teknologi skulle klara sig mot en invaderande styrka. Även atom-bomben kanske inte är en tillräckligt avskräckande. Det värsta som kan hända är att vi blir tvingade att använda nukleära missiler om vi inte hade något annat hopp att avärja angreppet.\n"
"\n"
"Verkstäderna är ett högrisk område beroende på de känsliga, ofta hemliga projekt. De olika farliga eller flyktiga substanser som används i produktionen gör det till en farlig plats att vara på och det kommer med all säkerhet vara i fara vid en bas attack som ett mål om de får en chans eller även ett objektiv vid en medel-riskabelt uppdrag. Att stänga ner vår produktion för en tid vore som en seger för våra utomjordiska fiender, särskilt om dom lyckas förstöra ett stort projekt under utveckling t.ex. konstruktionen av en ny flygfarkost.\n"
"\n"
"Kopiera interplanetarisk rymdskepps teknologi kommer att bli en absolut nödvändighet om vi någonsin ska kunna ta initiativet mot en utomjordisk styrka. Vi kan inte bara sitta ner och titta och behålla en defensiv ställning om vi vill få ett definitivt slut på en militär konflikt.

"Antimateria lagret är konstruerad att säkert lagra antimateria för senare användning, åtminstone så säkert som antimateria kan bli lagarat. Det är baserat runt en anvancerad magnetisk förvarings system vi har härlett från utomjordisk antimateria teknologi som vi kallar 'inre skal'. Det 'yttre skalet' består av flera strålnings luftslussar över huvudpassagerna, ett tungt bepansrat kontroll rum och en hop av annan säkerhet och förvarings åtgärder -- alla är konstruerade så att all strålning är inuti det yttre skalet.\n"
"\n"
"Det yttre skalets konstruktion har lånat mycket från Fn: s kärnvapens depåer. Ifall det blir problem i det inre skalet så finns det ett automatiskt säkerhets system som kommer att omedelbart låsa in innehållet tills det sjunkit till säkra nivåer. Faciliteten kommer först att stänga skyddsdörrarna, sen säkra varje luftsluss med låsstänget av volfram, fylla det yttre skalets atmosfär med strålningsskyddande gas och spruta in antichock skum bakom väggarna och sen försöka fånga upp den oundvikliga explosionen.\n"
"\n"
"Denna procedur kommer inte ge personalen innanför någon tid att fly men det är priset vi får betala om vi ska ha någon chans att rädda något av basen.\n"
"\n"
"För att förstå hur farlig denna byggnad verkligen är, att bygga ett Antimaterialager på en av våra baser kommer att tvinga oss att registrera den basen på FN: s Atomplats lista. Vid full kapacitet -- 10 gram av antimateria -- bara ett lager byggnad kommer förvara lika mycket som nästan halvt megaton TNT. Men detta är inte mycket om man jämför med en modern termonukleära vapen men det är nog för att förvandla hela basen och allt inuti till aska på mindre än en sekund. Det är svårt att 'spränga' antimateria men under de rätta förhållandena så kan det hända.\n"
"\n"
"Även om ingen explosion sker, så skulle en förlorad förvaring resultera i förintelse av den lagrade antimaterian så spelar det ingen roll för förvarings systemet. Om det var några fel eller skador på det yttre skalet vid detta tillfälle så skulle den följande vågen av gammastrålning och höghastighets partiklar läcka och förgöra området helt på liv. Basen skulle bli förgiftad och göras obeboelig för årtionden framåt.\n"

"Jag tror jag redan betonat att denna byggnad måste vara den mest försvarade byggnad i vilken PHALANX bas som helst och har t.om. högre prioritet än Kommandocentralen. Att förlora kommandocentralen vore absolut inte bra men den kan återuppbyggas. Kostnaden vore en struntsumma om man jämför vilken domedag det kan bli om det blir något missöde i Antimateria Lagret.\n"
"\n"
"Även om denna facilitet kommer vara väsentlig för vår fortsatta framgång i detta krig så kommer det bli väldigt dyrt att bygga och att driva pga de avancerade teknologin och material som behövs. Det kommer kanske bli nödvändigt att vänta med att bygga ett tills vi är säkra på att vi har råd i vår budget.\n"
"\n"
"Nu när jag sagt det, tills vi klarar att bygga en av denna facilitet så kommer vi vara helt oförmögna att lagra eller använda upphittad antimateria. Vi kan inte bara lägga ostabil, utomjordisk, kanske skadade tankar av atomkrafts sprängämnen på hög. Allt vi hittar måste bli förstörd pga säkerheten.\n"

There are only two surviving examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in government warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig out of storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I can't even find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us.

"The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered aviation fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"

It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose, which will mount anti-air weapons such as aircraft cannons or missile racks. It can also carry additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers and a cargo bay which can contain and deploy small battlefield vehicles.\n"

"\n"
"By: Dr. Richard Strohm, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"I'm very happy to report that the first production model of our next-generation interceptor has been completed and passed all of its flight tests with flying colours. At the risk of sounding boastful, it may be the finest piece of human technology ever produced.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at supersonic speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a sophisticated air channeling system that actively filters the air in front of the engine and redirects any piece of material large enough to harm the fan blades. They are more than powerful enough to lift the heavily-armoured fuselage and can hover unassisted for up to two hours before burning through all their fuel.\n"
"\n"
"The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to Mach 2 for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and a max velocity of 2.1 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto well ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise ability.\n"
"\n"
"Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its hangar complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the target at all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and acquire missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even complete.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. The Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a state-of-the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- but is not limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar system, and optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM emitters placed in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off missile lock and can actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints can take a variety of armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to accept upgrades. Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a premium.\n"
"\n"
"The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, its maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, within this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been described by our test crews as 'tricky'.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 3 weapon hardpoints; 1 small nose mount and 2 medium wing mounts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe with anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be deployed against targets more distant than 2000 kilometres from its hangar as it won't have enough fuel for both attack manoeuvres and the flight back to base. Inflight refuelling may be considered to extend the combat radius, but will require additional development.\n"
"\n"
"Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, but the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat comes for us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the human race is in trouble.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Cdr. Paul Navarre, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold they held in their hands. That is, until now. What we have here is probably the most manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack helicopters to shame and can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. It does things most modern aircraft can't even dream of.\n"
"\n"
"It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially at speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech assessment. However, our pilots inform me that they can handle it. Even better, we've managed to track down a complete intact specimen, and it's in the shop right now being restored to operation. I've given the go-ahead for a full refit and flight testing, on my authority. This is simply the best knife-fighting aircraft I have ever laid eyes on. We're going to need it.\n"

"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
"\n"
"Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military airplane still flying today.\n"
"\n"
"In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
"\n"
"Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, and more. The Saracen can carry about twice the electronics load of a Stiletto-class Interceptor, with room to spare for further modular equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts badly into weapons capacity. The Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that implies. Though it can take much more damage than a Stiletto and remain effective, the Saracen will not perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"The Saracen requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 2 weapon hardpoints; 2 medium belly bays.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.\n"
"\n"
"As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"

"Commander, I'm extremely proud to present you with the plans for our new interceptor, the Dragon. As you can see we've taken more than one page out of the aliens' book and the radical styling truly pays off.\n"
"\n"
"Incorporating new technologies from the ground up, the Dragon consists of an inner skeleton of alien materials providing strength for the lighter outer skin of carbon nanotube-reinforced plastics. This allows it to mount two actual alien engines which give speed and power like nothing else in our arsenal. The forward-swept wings are a special touch to allow it more knife-fighting mobility than alien designs.\n"

The upper two prongs can mount small retractable weapons, the bottom prong contains a medium-sized weapon compartment, and the central structure was designed to accomodate the main hardpoint -- the 'mouth', if you will -- for which the Dragon was named.\n"
"\n"
"The main drawback of the Dragon is that, like UFOs, it requires antimatter to get into the air. Nothing else will do considering the weight of the fuselage. Since our supplies of antimatter are so limited it may be that we can't afford to spend it on anything but our airfleet. That's why we should be careful about where we deploy the Dragon, and consider whether or not its deployment is really necessary in any given situation.\n"
"\n"
"Also, please note that while the Dragon is technically capable of entering orbit on its own steam, it has no space capabilities and should not be pushed above the upper atmosphere under any circumstances. Some things are just too much to ask right now. We're engineers, Commander, not wizards.\n"

"Commander, let me preface this by saying it's obvious that the aliens have been severely outperforming us in every way, but nowhere is this more evident than in the air. We were in a bad position at the start of the war and despite our efforts there has been little improvement.\n"
"\n"
"However, now that we have an understanding of alien materials and how they behave in the air, as well as alien engines and fuelling systems, I think my team and I are ready to tackle the task of creating an entirely new interceptor exclusive to PHALANX.

"Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the small UFO we captured. It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward to getting a chance to sink our own hooks into all this lovely technology.\n"
"\n"
"The craft's strange construction has raised a lot of questions for us to answer. Much of the design seems to make little sense when viewed from the ground. However, now that we've managed to look 'under the hood' and test the alien hull materials under laboratory conditions, we have gained a far clearer picture of UFO capabilities. I've made a list of our most important discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, and then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\n"
"\n"
"- We've found no evidence of landing gear or hover ability in this craft, implying that it isn't meant to land. If it loses both engines, it goes down.\n"
"\n"
"- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but even so I nearly had a heart attack when I found out what was in there. The maximum load -- two tenths of a gramme -- could create a blast yield of more than 8 kilotons. By comparison the bomb at Hiroshima was 13 kilotons. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as possible within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to jettison the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on the tank or the containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion represents an extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is that antimatter explosions create little to no radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"- The craft is extremely hard to see with our detection equipment. This is largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of radiation. We've had the most luck with infrared and gamma ray detection, as the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"- The slim design (generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in air) is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. Every gramme of excess matter has been stripped, and the craft moves fast enough to need very little wing surface. The material itself is quite astonishing, part metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a memory alloy, 'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a more compact form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a more comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's far stronger and tougher than anything we've ever known. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"- We have determined the craft to be unarmed, but it's equipped with what appears to be a large suite of sensors contained in the four protrusions around the cockpit. Curiously, it seems to mount no communications equipment whatsoever, but that would defeat its apparent role as a scout. Your guess is as good as ours, sir.\n"
"\n"
"We have dubbed this class of UFO the 'Scout', as that seems to be its purpose here on Earth. It is used primarily as a reconnaissance unit and vanguard to scout the way for heavier craft. Though unarmed, we should shoot these craft down if we are not otherwise engaged, because anything the aliens are up to is bound to be bad for us.\n"

"The Fighter craft seems to serve the role of escort to alien harvesting expeditions and similar operations. It is frequently deployed as a Harvester UFO's fighter wing, or even as a diversion to mask some other mission somewhere else.\n"
"\n"
"Though less manoeuvrable than the Scout craft, it is significantly faster, with a tougher airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the side to compensate for the increased power of the antimatter engines. It mounts a single weapons system under the nose of the craft. This weapon, some type of high-energy particle beam, will require thorough research before we will be able to make any conclusions about it. However, it's obvious just from our combat recordings that this weapon is extremely dangerous. It fires a beam of particles at a good fraction of the speed of light, giving it significant range before the atmosphere can slow and/or disperse the particles enough to render them harmless.\n"
"\n"
"The crew compartment is equipped with 3 duty stations. We have studied these intently and, as near as we can determine, they are designed a pilot, a gunner and an electronics officer. Like the Scout, the Fighter features no discernible communications equipment, nor does it mount landing gear. What it does have is a large targeting computer and holographic HUD to make the craft even more effective. These systems are very interesting. More research might lead us to great improvements in our own avionics.\n"
"\n"
"Our analysis has led us to some new realisations about these smaller classes of UFO. While faster than the Scout, the Fighter is still not very speedy for a craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien hull materials, the aliens could definitely build far more powerful engines with their current technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel volatility.\n"
"\n"
"The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are only slightly larger than those in the Scout, and they are very heavily armoured; obviously the aliens aren't taking any unnecessary risks. The few tenths of a gramme of antimatter that a small UFO can safely carry seem to be just enough to complete a planet mission and return to base. If the UFO does manage to get blown up, the amount of antimatter in its tanks will not be enough to harm any other craft in the formation.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Fighter is a real threat to PHALANX craft. They most often operate in pairs, a lead craft and a wingman, forming a tight, effective formation to protect larger and more vulnerable craft. However, their function is strictly limited, as they aren't equipped to do anything more than armed reconnaissance. The real threat will always be whatever the Fighters are protecting.

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"As far as we can determine, this type of UFO is indeed a transporter of some kind, carrying materials in its large cargo hold and up to 12 aliens in a small passenger compartment behind the cockpit. Satellite surveillance has observed these ships landing at alien-held positions and unloading material and passengers. This is strong evidence in support of the 'supply ship' theory, and we're confident that it's correct.\n"
"\n"
"We can make several conclusions from the UFO's construction and the cargo we've recovered from the hold. Unlike the UFOs we've recovered previously, the Supply Ship is built for carrying heavy loads rather than surviving combat. It doesn't manoeuvre very well, its engines are less powerful and fine-tuned, and its airframe will break up easily when hit. This is why a Supply Ship is often protected by a large screen of Fighter UFOs, in case it's intercepted.\n"
"\n"
"There isn't much that an alien cargo ship could be doing on Earth except reinforcement and resupply. It will be bringing in weapons, spare parts and other supplies from the alien homeworld down here to Earth in support of alien operations on the surface. This should be prevented at all costs -- permanent alien installations on Earth would place the civilian population in the area in extreme danger. A strong alien presence also hampers our operations in many ways, some too subtle to observe directly. The regular operation of Supply Ships in an area may indicate an alien installation under construction or, worse, one that's already operational.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, if we can prevent any Supply Ships from reaching an existing alien strongpoint, we may be able to starve it out for a while before sending in troops. This may give us a crucial tactical advantage.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, although it may seem of lesser importance than the other UFOs we've encountered, the Supply Ship should be engaged whenever possible. The long-term benefits of interrupting alien supplies may not be immediately apparent, but it will show over time.\n"

"\n"
"This UFO, which we've come to call the Corrupter, is a nightmare of alien medical technology. It makes only a few concessions to air combat. Its main purpose, without a shadow of a doubt, is to land on Earth and carry out hideous operations on human victims.\n"
"\n"
"Where previous alien equipment seemed to focus mostly on collecting human biomass, the Corrupter's interior -- particularly the massive blood transfusion banks -- are geared towards the capture and alteration of complete, live human beings. The alcoves I mentioned in my proposal are still mysterious, but going by the wear patterns on the floors they seem to be used to store some kind of heavy alien robot or cargo equipped with tank treads. Heavy harnesses drop down from the ceiling to hold these robots in place during flight, and the alcoves seem to have some type of air-drop mechanism as well.\n"
"\n"
"It's difficult to speculate exactly what exactly goes on in these UFOs with regards to captured civilians. Clearly it has something to do with the alien harvesting of human biomass, but they already have craft for that which do not appear to be in any way obsolete. Instead we have to suspect that the Corrupter represents a paradigm shift in alien activity on Earth. Something has changed. Until we fully understand what's happening, we need to prepare ourselves for what could be the worst threat to the global population we've ever seen.\n"
"\n"
"In the air the Corrupter's performance is relatively poor, being slow and sluggish compared to other UFOs, but from our observations it appears to be heavily escorted and presents a major ground threat due to its large crew complement and on-board heavy weapons. More than any other craft we've encountered, the Corrupter is purpose-built to deliver large alien forces to the surface solely to attack civilians.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, it's painfully obvious that we need to shoot these things down whenever and wherever we see them. If we don't, it's going to result in the wholesale slaughter of innocent people and possibly even scenes worse than Mumbai and Bonn.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"This craft -- which we've dubbed the 'Harvester' -- appears designed specifically for landing on a planetary surface and deploying an alien harvesting party. It is equipped with a set of large, sturdy landing legs and a special set of thrusters located in the UFO's belly to give it VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability. Once the landed Harvester's crew has collected enough captives, corpses and other biomass, they return to the UFO and lift off into orbit, quickly disappearing back to wherever it is they came from.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester seems to bear out our theories about fuel capacity being the main limiting factor for UFO speed, as it is both larger and faster than any other we've previously observed. It's able to carry more antimatter fuel and protect it far more effectively, with a tougher hull, thicker armour on the fuel tank, and more effective emergency antimatter-dumping measures. Even if an explosion does occur, most of the blast will be contained by the UFO's extremely strong construction.\n"
"\n"
"The Harvester's fuel tank can take up to 0.6 grammes of antimatter and possesses a potential explosive force of approximately 25 kilotons when full.\n"
"\n"
"There are three front-facing weapon mounts arranged in a triangle around the craft's cockpit. Two of these are equipped with the particle beam weapon we've observed in other UFOs, but the remaining mount features an interesting kind of alien missile launcher. The missiles have highly sophisticated homing systems and are propelled by matter-antimatter reaction rockets similar to UFO engines. These missiles are insanely fast, so fast that they don't need explosive warheads to kill their prey, relying solely on kinetic impact and the sympathetic detonation of any remaining fuel. More research into this weapon will be a high priority.\n"
"\n"
"In the air, the Harvester is extremely dangerous and should be a high-priority target. Between the twin particle beams and the alien launcher, its firepower is more than a match for anything we can currently field. Its only obvious flaw is a significant drop in manoeuvrability from the Scout and Fighter models. Our interceptors are significantly more agile and we have far more combat experience in Earth atmosphere than the aliens do. This is one of the few advantages we'll have against the Harvester, and it would be wise to upgrade our equipment in order to mitigate some of the aliens' tech superiority.\n"
"\n"
"When encountered, we should concentrate our best pilots on any and all Harvesters in the area and take them out as fast as possible. Only then should we concern ourselves with shooting down any escorts.\n"
"\n"
"Our analysis of the Harvester's increased capabilities over the Scout raises some frightening points. It seems that alien craft will actually grow faster as they become larger and more powerful, and there's no doubt that, if they can build these Harvesters, they can build bigger and nastier UFOs. We should try to adapt the alien antimatter technologies to our own interceptors as soon as possible so that we can get on an even footing with the aliens now and will be able to stand up to more dangerous threats in the future.\n"

"In proportion to its body weight, the Ortnok has more muscle than a professional body builder. At first we concluded this was solely the product of an extreme-heavy-gravity homeworld, but subsequent hormone and toxicology work on our specimen have revealed something interesting. The subject seems to have been raised from birth on a heavy diet of genetic tampering and anabolic steroids. This, combined with the incredible density of the muscle tissue, makes the Ortnok physically stronger than any biological entity on Earth.\n"
"\n"
"During our first incisions, we were surprised to find the Ortnok to be without blood. It has lungs, viscera and something akin to digestive organs, but no liver or heart that we can identify. Instead of veins there is a very well-developed system of nerve tubes, filled with a kind of electrically conductive gel, that seems to power and control the muscles by direct electrical stimulation. The needed electricity is generated through digestion of organic matter and stored in a set of large eel-like organs underneath the lungs. The nervous system itself is nourished by the leftover products of the digestion process by way of veins filled with pressurised air. The whole chest cavity has been richly furnished with armour plating inserted just underneath the leathery green skin.\n"
"\n"
"The eyes are covered with surgically-implanted lenses that improve the Ortnok's already excellent vision, stretching it into the infrared spectrum. The ears consist of a series of small cavities, three on either side of the head, which are surprisingly large and well-developed. Given the evidence we must conclude that Ortnoks have acute hearing, though the nose and olfactory organs are quite small, atrophied almost to the point of being vestigial.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The brain is fairly small for a hominid of such size, no larger than that of Homo erectus, but it is perhaps sufficient for the role of foot soldier. Ortnoks certainly don't display any tactical sluggishness on the battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"- The three-fingered hand is able to carry and use a wide variety of equipment. However, Ortnoks are most often equipped with heavy weapons to match their size.\n"
"\n"
"- Ortnoks are strong, tough and dangerous. Their internal armour enhances their natural endurance even further, making them difficult to take down. Armour-piercing rounds or incendiary weapons are recommended. Lasers, explosives and cutting weapons will not be very effective due to the extensive armouring.\n"
"\n"
"- All Ortnok specimens we've seen so far were not equipped with reproductive organs. From surgical scarring around the groin area, we believe they may have been neutered for some reason.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, specimens seem to be used most often in the role of heavy infantry and fire support. They are not particularly accurate with their somewhat cumbersome weapons, but when working in numbers they usually lay down enough fire to suppress and then annihilate a PHALANX squad. Ortnoks do not seem to serve in many specialist capacities; they are never used as technicians according to our camera observations, and usually busy themselves handling perimeter security for the Tamans when not engaged in combat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"We have no idea quite where the name 'Ortnok' came from. The troops don't seem to know, and neither do we. Still, it's as good a name as any, and it seems to have stuck.\n"

"My team and I have completed our autopsy of the 'grey' body we recovered. Here is my summary of our findings.\n"
"\n"
"When Commonwealth troops first arrived in Mumbai, confused and apprehensive, they were swarmed by crowds of screaming locals, terrified out of their minds and desperate for protection. Most of the soldiers didn't even speak the language, unable to understand what was said. When they asked what was wrong, the civilians simply cried, \"xuRta AwmA\" -- the Hindi term for 'evil spirit' or 'demon'.\n"
"\n"
"Under fire, the term quickly shortened to \"Taama\", and by the time the shooting was over it had further mutated. Everyone had settled on \"Taman\" (pronounced 'tah-man') as the word that described the grey nightmares that had slaughtered them. The name still remains, but we can now say with confidence that these aliens are made of flesh and blood rather than fire and darkness.\n"
"\n"
"First and probably most interesting is the fact that this creature looks almost human. Two arms, two legs, a torso and a head; bipedal locomotion; visual, olfactory and auditory organs all in the same general location. The subject's hands and feet have three long digits, one of which (the 'thumb') is opposable. This species is on average shorter than humans and possesses a thin, almost delicate frame which belies their toughness.\n"
"\n"
"The subject has a very simple set of vital organs; heart, lungs, liver, and so on. It lacks most of the redundant or obsolete organs that humans have carried through our evolutionary history. Biologically, the most interesting part of the subject's internals is the digestive tract. The creature has a total of three stomachs meant for the digestion of very tough plant matter. It is incapable of digesting meat of any kind. This implies that, wherever they come from, the Tamans are herbivores feeding on some kind of plant life. This finding has comforted some of our more excitable staff. At least we know the aliens aren't harvesting us for our meat.\n"
"\n"
"There is a complex set of implants in the subject's throat that will require further research to be fully understood. I will send you a more detailed analysis along with a research proposal.\n"
"\n"
"The large, overdeveloped eyes equip the Taman with natural night-vision. It has special irises that protect the retinas from bright light such as sunlight, but if a sudden blast of highly intense illumination were to hit the retina before the iris can adjust, it could cause prolonged or even permanent blindness. Our flashbang may be highly effective here.\n"
"\n"
"The greyness of the skin is a particularly curious feature. It is actually caused by the secretion of trace amounts of silicon, which hardens over the supple inner skin to provide a kind of natural armour. This makes a Taman fairly resistant to impact and heat.\n"
"\n"
"From our analysis, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"-- The Tamans have a natural resistance to bullets and blunt trauma, but not enough to render such weapons combat ineffective.\n"
"\n"
"-- Their skin easily disperses small to medium amounts of heat, but prolonged exposure to a flamethrower or incendiary compound will still do the trick. Lasers will do slightly less damage than normal.\n"
"\n"
"-- Though the body is limber and elastic, the Taman's internal organs are badly protected against concussion, which makes them particularly vulnerable to the shockwaves of explosive ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"Further study has ruled out other wild-eyed theories. Though the Tamans' appearance is very similar to that of humans, almost enough to imply a kind of relationship, they seem to be more a case of convergent evolution (two different paths to a similar end result) than a blood relation. There are very few similarities between the Taman gene sequences and that of humans, and the structure of chromatin in their DNA is several orders of magnitude more complex than ours. This seems to preclude a hypothetical common origin.\n"
"\n"
"In combat, Tamans present a significant threat. They are highly agile and can wield a variety of weapons with great accuracy. Besides serving as soldiers, they fill many specialist roles in the alien war machine, positions in which Tamans seem to be the most numerous. Complex weapons and advanced armour are more often wielded by Tamans than any other species. This is most likely due to their large brains, sensory organs and delicate manipulators.\n"
"\n"
"Whether or not the Tamans are the 'greys' of old UFO abduction stories, I couldn't say, but it seems extremely unlikely. PHALANX has never been able to verify a single report of alien activity since the 1950s. The UFOs we're seeing now are certainly not flying saucers. If they could've invaded Earth a century ago, why wait until now to do it? It doesn't really add up -- but then, who can know the motivations of an alien mind?\n"

"Vår obduktion av denna nya utomjording -- Shevaar -- har varit mycket intressant. Det är en betydande avikelse från de mer männskliga Tamans och Ortnoks, de har tågångande ben och en liten svans som tycks vara en kvarleva av denna arts fortsatta utveckling. Varelsen verkar också vara helt blind. Den saknar ögon eller något annat organ som skulle kunna ta emot visuellt ljus. Däremot verkar det som att den har andra organ som kompenserar för denna bristfälliga syn.\n"
"\n"
"Först och främst, Shevaar ser ut som en ohelig förening mellan en man och en ödla. Till skillnad från de flesta av jordens ödlor så är utomjordingarna varmblodiga och deras hjärna har en liknande storlek som vår egna -- antagligen en aning större. Deras enorma fötter är förvånansvärt fjädrande, och kan förflytta sig snabbt i en hoppande gångstil. De stora händerna verkar inte ha några problem att hantera de många olika vapen som finns i den utomjordiska arsenalen.\n"
"\n"
"Resultaten av obduktionen är inte mindre intressant. När vi skar upp bröstkorgen fann vi att revbenen var en solid sköld av ben på hela framsidan, förstärkt med styv brosk. Sammansättningen av benen är dessutom olik vår egen, gjord mestadels av kol istället för av kalcium, med spår av metall som gör det oerhört hårt och tufft. Knivar och kulor har svårt att penetrera det och det kommer att bli svårt att skada vitala organ. All kroppsmassa som inte är skyddad av dessa ben verkar vara gjort av mager, trådaktiga muskler.\n"
"\n"
"Hjärnan är särskilt välskyddad. Flera lager av horn lindat runt den som ett ointrängligt kroppsskydd. Från alla märken av slitage kring detta område antar vi att dessa utomjordingar ofta skallas, som en del i deras uppvaktnings ritualer. En liten mun skjuter fram från alla ben och leder ner till en enkel men funktionsdugligt matsmältningsområde.\n"
"\n"
"Men det finns mer organ i huvudet än bara hjärnan och munnen. Bakom de ringlande benen så finns det tre organ som verkar upptäcka infraröd strålning. Detta är tydligen vad Shevaaren använder istället för ögon. Vi har förstått att känsligheten av dessa organ är ungefär jämförbart som om en människa använder PHALANX standard IR Glasögon.\n"
"\n"
"Från obduktionen och vår analys av slagfälts bilder så har vi kommit fram till följande:\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar ser med infraröd syn. Det kommer att göra det svårt att gömma sig från dom eller att närma sig oupptäckt.\n"
"\n"
"- Dom bär mestadels lätt utrustning för att behålla deras naturliga rörlighet. Det tillåter dom att utföra effektiv överrasknings taktiker.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaarens kroppar är mycket resistenta mot slag och skärskador och deras kompakta inre blir inte så lätt skadat av tryckvågor eller sprängämnen. Men deras fjälliga hud ger dom väldigt lite skydd mot eld, laser och elektricitet.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar är mest använd som en snabb bepansrad spanare. De är extremt effektiva i denna roll, kombinerad hög rörlighet med utökad synegenskaper. Utomjordingarna verkar inte ha någon brist på dessa varelser. Shevaar verkar vara placerad mellan Tamans och Ortnoks i den suddiga utomjordiska rangordningen, i vilken de ibland har rollen som specialister eller befäl, olikt Ortnoks, men dessa uppgifter är fortfarande mestadels Tamanen när de två raserna har skickats ut tillsammans.\n"
"\n"
"När den inte är i strid så spenderar Shevaar mesta tiden som en spanare eller skytt eller som vakt för fångade människor.\n"
"\n"
")Det är ett invecklad uppsättning implantat i objektets hals som kommer kräva mer forskning för att helt förstås. Jag kommer skicka dig en mer detaljerad analys tillsamans med ett forsknings förslag.\n"
"\n"
"Vi borde vara försiktiga när vi träffar på dessa utomjordingar på fältet. De är snabba och farliga skyttar som föredrar att strida från ett skydd och borde bli förföljd och skjutas mot konstant, när den upptäcks så länge inte detta sprider ut våra positioner. Blotta våra soldaters flanker eller bakom dom för en Shevaar styrka kan få katastrofala följder. Även om granater antagligen inte kommer döda en Shevaar på en gång så kan de vara användbara för att få ut dom in i våra styrkors sikten.\n"
"\n"
"Även om den är blind så har Shevaar balans organ som påverkas av ljudet av våra chockgranater. Det resulterar i ett liknande reaktion hos dom som hos människor.\n"

"Our autopsy of this new alien -- the Shevaar -- has been very interesting. It's a significant departure from the more humanoid Tamans and Ortnoks, possessing digitigrade legs and a small tail that seems to be a remnant of this species's continuing evolution. The creature also appears to be completely blind. It lacks eyes and any other kind of organ that could be used to process visual light. However, it seems to have other interesting organs to make up for this deficiency.\n"
"\n"
"First off, the Shevaar looks like the unholy merger of a man and a lizard. Unlike most Earth lizards, however, the alien is warm-blooded and its brain is similar in size to our own -- probably slightly larger. Its massive feet are surprisingly springy, and it can cover large amounts of ground in a long, leaping gait. The large hands seem to have no problem wielding the many varieties of alien weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"The results of the autopsy are no less interesting. Upon cutting upon the chest, we find that the rib cage is a solid shield of bone down the front, reinforced with stiff cartilege. The makeup of the bones is different from ours as well, made up mostly of carbon rather than calcium, with traces of metal that make them extremely hard and tough. Knives and bullets will have a great deal of trouble penetrating it, and it will be even harder to find vital organs to damage. Any body mass that isn't shielded by bone seems to be made up only of lean, wiry muscle.\n"
"\n"
"The brain is particularly heavily-defended. Several layers of horn wrap around it like an impenetrable suit of armour. From the marks of wear and tear around this area, we surmise that these aliens regularly engage in vigorous head-butting, probably as part of their mating rituals. A small, omnivorous mouth protrudes from the mass of bone and leads down to a simple but functional digestive tract.\n"
"\n"
"There are more organs in the head than just the brain and the mouth, however. Behind the curls of bone there is a set of three organs that seem to detect infrared radiation. This is apparently what the Shevaar uses in lieu of eyes. We conclude that the sensitivity of these organs is roughly comparable to that of a human wearing PHALANX-standard IR Goggles.\n"
"\n"
"From the autopsy and our analysis of battlefield footage, we can conclude the following:\n"
"\n"
"- The Shevaar see in infrared. This will make it difficult to hide from them or approach them undetected.\n"
"\n"
"- They carry mostly light equipment to preserve their natural mobility. This allows them to employ effective hit-and-run tactics.\n"
"\n"
"- Shevaar bodies are highly resistant to impact and cutting damage, and their compact internals are not easily damaged by concussion or explosives. However, their scaly hides provide little protection from fire, lasers or electricity.\n"
"\n"
"Shevaar are most often used as fast, armoured scouts. They're extremely effective in this role, combining high mobility with extended vision capabilities, and the aliens seem to have no shortage of these creatures. The Shevaar seem to be located between Tamans and Ortnoks in the nebulous alien hierarchy, in that they sometimes fill specialist or command roles, unlike Ortnoks, but these tasks are still usually taken by Tamans whenever the two races are deployed together.\n"
"\n"
"When not engaged in combat, Shevaar spend most of their time as scouts or skirmishers, or as herders for captured humans.\n"
"\n"
"We should be careful whenever we encounter these aliens in the field. They are fast and dangerous skirmishers who prefer to fight from cover, and should be pursued and kept under fire at all times when discovered, as long as this does not overextend our position. Exposing our team's flanks or rear to a squad of Shevaar could have disastrous results. Although grenades are unlikely to kill any Shevaar outright, they will be very useful for flushing them out into our troops' sights.\n"
"\n"
"Also, although blind, Shevaar possess balance organs that are affected by the sound of our flashbang. It will achieve similar results on them as it does on humans.\n"

"Commander, we've finished work on this big damned cannon we brought back.\n"

"We've always suspected that a real alien army would field more than just plasma weapons and Kerrblades. Now they've gone and proved us right. This particle beam weaponry is extremely advanced, a quantum leap above the plasma weapons, miniaturised far beyond our ability to duplicate.\n"
"\n"
"Particle-beam weaponry is designed to hit a target object with a stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore carrying tremendous kinetic energy. Until now we've only seen the aliens use this technology in large UFO weapons. Now, however, they're using it on the ground in the worst way.\n"

"This cannon has got to be the most powerful infantry particle beam the aliens can field, because I can't imagine them getting much bigger.

No normal human will be able to use this weapon. We can adapt it for mounting on our UGVs, and we may be able to enhance our soldiers with cybernetic implants or powered armour, but that's all.\n"
"\n"
"As bad as the recoil is, the target will have it worse. A single fleeting hit -- a heartbeat of exposure -- will buckle three inches of homogenous steel and blow the target back by several metres. This is usually all that's necessary. A second hit will turn the buckle into a fist-sized hole, clean through. Our infantry armour will perform only slightly better, but deflection will help somewhat.\n"
"\n"
"The cannon's mechanics are quite simple, nothing that we can't duplicate easily with enough money and effort. The only thing we have yet to figure out is the ammo supply. The energy readings we've taken from the magazines are extreme, and despite our efforts, we haven't managed to disable or disarm one in order to safely open it up. Even shooting it dry doesn't completely deactivate one of these magazines. More research will be required before we can try and understand them, much less reproduce them.\n"
"\n"
"That's all I've got for you right now, Commander. I'll keep you updated on our progress with the magazines.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Under the continuing efforts of the Excalibur Program, we have scoured the globe for the best components on Earth in order to fit our aircraft with the equipment they need to survive against the alien threat. As always, only the very best equipment has been selected for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"Electronic warfare has been a part of military operations ever since radar first appeared on the battlefield in World War 2. Ways of defeating radar were constantly under development since it appeared on the shores of Britain, methods such as flying below the height of the transmitter, throwing radar-scrambling 'chaff', and in later years the advent of stealth technology. It has always been better to have the enemy detect your presence later rather than sooner -- or not at all. Even better, your enemy can't shoot what he can't see.\n"
"\n"
"Just like the Mk. 1 Eyeball, electronic detection and targeting can be fooled, and the devices which fool electronic detection and targeting can be fooled in turn. It's a never-ending struggle for superiority which falls under the term 'Electronic Warfare'. ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) serve to protect the craft with which they are equipped by jamming, deception, decoys and other such stratagems. ECCM (Electronic Counter-Counter-Measures) on the opposing side try to counteract the effect of ECM. And one thing is clear; the aliens are very good at both.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, we have adopted the \"Raven\" Electronic Warfare Suite, the most advanced ECM package available in the world, for PHALANX service. It is the best humanity has to offer in the field of disrupting enemy detection, tracking and homing mechanisms. Any aircraft equipped with this piece of kit will have a significantly higher survivability rate against missiles and other independent munitions. It's less effective against aircraft guns, as their targeting equipment is contained on-board and therefore can't be as easily fooled or jammed, but even against these the \"Raven\" unit provides a noteworthy benefit.\n"
"\n"
"It is very expensive thanks to its advanced electronics and takes up a complete modular slot on one of our aircraft, but one thing is certain; its price tag isn't half as high as the cost of losing one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We recommend that every aircraft expected to go up against armed UFOs carry either one of these ECM units or an additional skin of Polymer Aircraft Armour. Even against superior alien systems the additional protection of the \"Raven\" will help our pilots achieve our goals in the skies of Earth. The expense may seem prohibitive, but the survival of our craft and pilots will certainly justify these costs in the long run.\n"

"\n"
"One of the fundamental truths in aircraft design is that it's easier to dish out damage than it is to take it and keep coming. Heavy objects don't really belong in the sky; it takes a constant input of power to keep things like aircraft, birds and balloons from coming back down, and if the source of this power is damaged in mid-flight, a crash is unavoidable. PHALANX uses exclusively multi-engine aircraft, but even though it's possible for our interceptors to land on only one engine, the loss of an engine during combat will immediately render the aircraft combat-ineffective. With such a drastic loss of speed and manoeuvring power, continuing the engagement would be suicide\n"
"\n"
"Adding extra armour to our aircraft is a weighty but effective solution to keeping them in the sky, protecting critical systems from damage and allowing the aircraft to stay in the fight longer than would otherwise be possible. It will reduce the severity of hits to the fuel tank and other vital systems that might otherwise result in the craft's instant destruction.\n"
"\n"
"The expensive polymer used in our standard add-on armour is one of the toughest materials on the planet. It deforms wildly under heat and pressure, such as when impacted by kinetic or explosive energy, cushioning the blow across the entire armour surface. Once the energy has dissipated, the deformed plate amazingly resumes all or most of its previous shape, depending on the amount of damage received. We even have facilities in our Workshops to repair permanently-deformed polymer plates once the aircraft returns to base.\n"
"\n"
"On the downside, the added weight will slow the aircraft down and significantly decrease its effective range. This is less of an issue for quick short-range interceptions, but can cause problems if UFOs are spotted in areas far distant from any of our bases.\n"
"\n"
"Installing this armour add-on will completely take up the modular armour slot on one of our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to restrict this armour add-on to craft which are meant to make quick, short-range interceptions not far from their base. The installation of add-on armour on our long-range interceptors is left to the Commander's discretion, but limiting their effective range in this manner can be dangerous, as it will be several hours' work to strip off the armour once it's put on. During this time the interceptor will be 'in the shop' and unable to launch. Any rearming or refuelling of the aircraft will have to wait until the installation/removal is complete. Our techs can't work on this material with dangerous munitions or fuel on-site.\n"
"\n"
"Scrambling an aircraft during a half-finished armour job is possible but not recommended. The craft will be highly unbalanced and in danger of crashing because of unpredictable handling and behaviour. It certainly won't be able to fight, as its targeting electronics will have been shut down for the duration of the maintenance cycle, and they cannot be booted up in time to be effective in a scramble situation.\n"

"Commander, now that we have the ability to produce and work the alien materials, a whole new range of options has opened up to us. These materials are so strong and flexible that they can be used for almost anything. Their most promising uses, however, have been in aircraft design -- specifically armour.\n"
"\n"
"We've had an extremely difficult time shooting down UFOs thanks to the resilient outer skin of alien materials. Unfortunately we can't simply slap this same kind of skin onto our own craft because the alien materials are far too heavy. Our craft would struggle to even get off the ground. That needn't be the end of it, though.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, if you let us do some research on it, I believe we can come up with an armouring scheme that -- while it might decrease speed and increase fuel consumption a bit -- should give our aircraft a far better survival chance against the alien weapons during interceptions. According to our calculations, aircraft with this kind of armour could withstand several particle beam hits and still remain combat effective.\n"

"Commander, I've got some good news. My team and I have finished prototyping the alien aircraft plating project. Our new armour is now ready for full PHALANX production.\n"
"\n"
"This has been a difficult project from the start. We've faced several major challenges in designing equipment capable of bending the alien materials into the shapes we want, and 'programming' the materials to change when we want and how we want them to do so. Ultimately we overcame these problems, but then we had to deal with the natural limitations of the material.\n"
"\n"
"The main drawback of these alien materials is their weight. They are significantly heftier than modern human aircraft materials, and anything we make from them will suffer from the extra weight. The only way the aliens manage to keep their wingless UFOs in the sky is through overwhelming engine power. Airspeed, manoeuvrability, fuel consumption, maximum operational range -- all these will be negatively affected by putting alien materials onto our aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"However, it's a sacrifice we don't seem to have any choice in making. Even a very thin skin of alien materials offers a substantial protective benefit, shrugging off hits that would turn our Polymer Aircraft Armour to paste. During air trials of the new armour, one of our own \"Sparrowhawk\" missiles -- which can bring down most Earth-built aircraft in a single hit -- failed to inflict significant harm to the test craft. I'm not even joking. We've got half an hour of compiled test footage that will confirm everything I just said.\n"
"\n"
"The new aircraft plating we've designed takes full advantage of these capabilities and shows the supreme toughness of the alien materials. The armour can take Particle Beam Weapon hits at point blank range without breaking up. For the very first time, our aircraft will be able to soak up tremendous amounts of damage and still keep flying like the aliens do. I wouldn't say we're quite in the same league yet, but we're getting there.\n"
"\n"
"It may only be feasible to use this armour on aircraft equipped with alien propulsion or otherwise upgraded engines, due to the increased weight and reduced speed and range. Still, even if that turns out to be the case, the new plating will be essential in keeping our current airfleet effective against the mounting alien threat. You and I both know the price tag of new aircraft, Commander -- we cannot afford to let any of our planes become obsolete.\n"

"Commander, we've finished work on the captured alien astrogation unit. Here is a summary of my report.\n"
"\n"
"We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its core, a purpose-built computer of extraordinary power loaded with specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of astronomical notation which we've decided to adopt in order to make use of this alien hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel time', 'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. These filters can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the exact course you want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-light capability when plotting a course, which all but verifies the theory that the aliens do indeed have access to some type of FTL technology.\n"
"\n"
"The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a star chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We have never found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. Perhaps only UFOs with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would surely need it for navigation.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered so far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface maps of the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-undiscovered moon of Pluto), spectrum analyses of every body in the asteroid belt as well as the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every body in the solar system plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're not sure if this information will be of any use to us, but it will greatly enhance humanity's body of knowledge about our home system -- whenever we're allowed to release it into the public.\n"
"\n"
"It's possible to program our own star charts into the astrogation unit, but I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be compared to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar travel with these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in the meantime we could certainly use these units to navigate around the solar system if we could design a PHALANX craft capable of launching into space. They will greatly simplify the whole process of interplanetary travel to the point where we'd be able to launch missions to Saturn or even Pluto at the click of a button.\n"

"Commander, I'm happy to report the success of our alien propulsion program. We've cracked the mysteries of the alien engine set-up and we finally understand the path of the antimatter from fuel tank to reaction chamber.\n"
"\n"
"Quoting from my previous report:\n"
"\n"
"(UFO Theory) \"The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, and then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\"\n"
"\n"
"With this project we've learned a lot about how these engines are constructed, how to control them, and how we might retrofit them to our current airfleet. We should now be able to replicate these engines and use them for any applications we might come up. I have to warn you, though; they will be extremely expensive to produce. Between the complex use of alien materials, the sensitive electromagnetics and the liquid nitrogen cooling system, this really stretches the limits of our production capacity.\n"
"\n"
"Some more research may be required to figure out antimatter storage and control, but the engine upgrades are self-contained units -- basically just an alien engine with adapters on it for human tech. We should be able to start retrofitting as soon as we acquire enough fuel to keep our airfleet in the sky.\n"
"\n"
"I've mentioned before, the power disparity between our liquid fuel and these matter-antimatter engines is nothing short of astonishing. When we start using these engines on our planes, our pilots are going to need some serious re-education about the capabilities of their craft. Let me explain.\n"
"\n"
"In a regular military jet, giving her a little too much throttle around a tight corner can result in impaired judgment and unconsciousness from the force of acceleration. Pilots have died from over-acceleration.\n"
"\n"
"In an antimatter jet, however, these problems are amplified hundred-fold. The engines are so powerful that over-acceleration can easily turn a human body to bloody pulp in its flight chair. Even the craft itself may have trouble coping with the acceleration, and our flight engineers will have to be extremely careful in checking for metal fatigue, hairline fractures and other wear and tear on the airframe. A tiny crack in the structure may result in one of our planes breaking up in mid-flight. Mechanical thrust limiters can only do so much -- most of the G-stresses are incurred during turns.\n"
"\n"
"Still, it shouldn't become a problem as long as everyone -- pilots and mechanics alike -- is extremely careful in their assigned tasks. We've done some serious tightening-up of our safety and inspection protocol just for antimatter planes. The retraining of our pilots is the only remaining obstacle to our use of these alien engines.\n"

"The project on alien detection is complete, Commander. We now have a full understanding of the machinery, its controls, and the modifications needed for human use.\n"
"\n"
"Our initial assessment looks to have been correct. The detection suite makes use mostly of standard, reliable detection methods that humanity either uses or knows about. The equipment is more advanced than ours and will be useful, but by and large the aliens apply the same concepts and use the same physics as we do. As I mentioned in my proposal, radar, lidar and other such old reliables are all well-represented in the suite.\n"
"\n"
"And then there's the mystery sensor.\n"
"\n"
"It had us confounded for a long time, because now that it's here on the Earth's surface, it spits out mostly overpowering background noise. Up in the air, however, the picture is quite different. We think we've now identified the detector and have figured out how it works.\n"
"\n"
"In the simplest terms, it's a gravity sensor, scanning for minute changes in a background gravitational field. Everything travelling through a gravity field disturbs the field to some degree based on its size, mass and composition. The sensor can identify these changes as natural or artificial objects based on course, speed and acceleration with 95% accuracy. If there is any doubt about a contact, the system will report it anyway. It seems to be more effective in stronger fields like the one around Earth, but we surmise that it will work to some extent anywhere within the gravity range of a star.\n"
"\n"
"All of this detection power is linked into an advanced computer system which automatically puts all results through a series of filters, which can be adjusted at any time to suit the needs of the pilot and crew. This helps alternately sifting out targets from a mess of background noise or increasing sensitivity to search for something stealthy.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, the detection computer seems to have a direct link to fire control, assisting in anticipating target manoeuvres and point defence control if the craft has that capability.\n"
"\n"
"Parts of this technology can be adapted to our existing ground-based installations and aircraft radar. It should extend their detection range and increase resolution across the board, making it a good deal harder for UFOs to hide. However, the biggest practical gains will come from using this tech in creating new aircraft instrumentation to increase the combat survivability of our interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, it's not the immediate uses that are the most important. These detectors are vital for any future PHALANX spacecraft. In space, without the support of ground radar, we're going to need the extra power very badly.\n"

"This is one of several proposals I'm submitting for the research and development of new laser weaponry. Each of these will have to be developed separately due to the size differences, power levels and complexity of the systems involved.\n"
"\n"
"The Aerial Laser Cannon is the largest and most powerful iteration of our new laser designs. Like our infantry weapons it'll be powered by deuterium-fluoride reaction, but on a much larger scale and amplified by the aircraft's on-board electrical systems. Several exciting ideas are being considered.\n"
"\n"
"As well as being the biggest, this may well be our most challenging laser to create. Any aircraft cannon will have to reach across several kilometres of atmosphere -- and therefore loads of atmospheric blooming -- with enough punch at the endpoint to cut into a UFO's fuselage. Those sorts of power levels have been achieved before with massive arrays mounted on jumbo jets, but never in a package small enough to make a jet fighter cannon.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is a four-barreled rotary cannon, firing the 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) round. It is an externally-powered gun -- rather than being dependent upon recoil to actuate the system, it uses an external motor to produce power. The electric motor which drives the SHIVA is a high-efficiency 20 horse power beast, achieving a rate of fire up to 6,000 rounds a minute with the accurate, hard-hitting 20mm HMG shells.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and built in Bangladesh, the SHIVA was first prototyped in 2048, failing every one of its trials during that year. The project was nearly discontinued until, in July 2050, an undercover investigation revealed a long-running sabotage plot by a rival arms company. A new prototype was constructed which showed enough promise justify further development. Eventually all the major bugs were ironed out, at which point the power of this weapon became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA is very light for an aircraft weapon of its size and effectiveness, weighing only 250 kilos unloaded, 400 kilos loaded. The rate of fire exceeds that of any other four-barreled cannon in existence. Its sophisticated tracking systems can hold a bead on an enemy for as long as there is a radar, lidar or optical target solution available. The unlinked ammo feeds are highly reliable and no jam has ever been recorded throughout the gun's service history.\n"
"\n"
"The SHIVA can fire two varieties of the HMG round; API (Armour-Piercing Incendiary) or HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary). The former achieves better penetration while the latter can do more damage if penetration is achieved. Both these rounds are proven to be capable of penetrating UFO armour to some degree.\n"
"\n"
"The largest issue with the SHIVA cannon is that it does only limited damage to a UFO, requiring a fairly long engagement time in order to bring a target down on its own. This also allows the enemy plenty of opportunity to escape or peg our craft with return fire. On the other hand, its large magazine gives it more staying power than most other weapons, and it is not to be underestimated.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Low damage and long engagement times somewhat limit the SHIVA's usefulness. However, most of these failings can be amended or eliminated if the gun is used in numbers or as part of a mixed gun-and-missiles armament. It can provide continuous automatic fire while the pilot concentrates on delivering his missiles, or it can be part of a gunboat configuration -- one or more interceptors loaded with as many cannons as possible, bringing down a UFO by sheer weight of lead.\n"
"\n"
"We currently have too little experience to recommend a most-effective way to engage alien craft with or without this weapon, but until we manage to capture some UFO weapon mounts, the SHIVA will remain the best dogfighting gun Earth has to offer.\n"

"\n"
"This is a pallet of 20mm API (Armour-Piercing Incendiary) ammunition for the SHIVA Rotary Cannon. It can contain up to 10,000 rounds.\n"
"\n"
"This high-powered anti-aircraft munition consists of a hard titanium-steel shell, tipped with depleted uranium, and filled with a core of explosive incendiary compound. Once the shell penetrates the outer skin of an aircraft, the core detonates, blowing the shell apart like a fragmentation grenade and spreading incendiary compound over the target area. Critical systems may be damaged before the incendiary compound can be quenched or compartmentalised.\n"
"\n"
"The advantage of the API round over the HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary) is its improved penetration, giving each round a better chance of causing some damage if a hit is scored. Penetrating API hits do not cause nearly as much damage as penetrating HEI hits, however.\n"
"\n"
"Each SHIVA cannon is loaded standard with a full pallet of 10,000 rounds, unless there are not enough rounds available in base storage.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"It's a tough choice between API and HEI ammo in most situations. If we're expecting to engaging thickly-armoured enemies or have only limited aircraft available to intercept, API is the round of choice. If we're engaging heavily-armed, highly dangerous craft, then massed HEI fire may be one of the quickest ways to take it down.\n"
"\n"
"We can switch out a gun's ammunition in a matter of minutes, but we can't load both types into the same gun. The variable pressure of firing different ammunition can cause misfires and may result in extreme damage to the gun and the aircraft. Both UN safety procedures and the manufacturer's manual absolutely forbid it, and I can't help but agree.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This is a pallet of 20mm HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary) ammunition for the SHIVA Rotary Cannon. It can contain up to 10,000 rounds.\n"
"\n"
"This high-powered anti-aircraft munition consists of a hard titanium-steel shell, tipped with depleted uranium, and filled with a core of explosive incendiary compound. Once the shell penetrates the outer skin of an aircraft, the core detonates, blowing the shell apart like a fragmentation grenade and spreading incendiary compound over the target area. Critical systems may be damaged before the incendiary compound can be quenched or compartmentalised. HEI rounds are especially good at this as they pack more incendiary compound and blast it over a far larger area.\n"
"\n"
"The advantage of the HEI round over the API (Armour-Piercing Incendiary) is its improved damage potential, giving each round a better chance of disabling or destroying the target if a hit is scored. HEI hits do not penetrate the target's armour as often as API hits, however. If the angle is unfavourable, HEI hits tend to bounce off without causing damage.\n"
"\n"
"Each SHIVA cannon is loaded standard with a full pallet of 10,000 rounds, unless there are not enough rounds available in base storage.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"It's a tough choice between API and HEI ammo in most situations. If we're expecting to engaging thickly-armoured enemies or have only limited aircraft available to intercept, API is the round of choice. If we're engaging heavily-armed, highly dangerous craft, then massed HEI fire may be one of the quickest ways to take it down.\n"
"\n"
"We can switch out a gun's ammunition in a matter of minutes, but we can't load both types into the same gun. The variable pressure of firing different ammunition can cause misfires and may result in extreme damage to the gun and the aircraft. Both UN safety procedures and the manufacturer's manual absolutely forbid it, and I can't help but agree.\n"

"\n"
"Now that we have aircraft capable of intercepting the attacking UFOs, we need to equip them with armaments that can actually shoot down these alien craft. We have evaluated every available weapon on Earth as part of the Excalibur Program, and we have selected the very best for the defence of our planet.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles have been humanity's primary anti-air weapon since the Vietnam war. The development of advanced Beyond-Visual-Range detection systems and the advent of guided missiles have moved combat engagements further and further away from the actual aircraft. Cannons, while not replaced, have taken a back seat to missiles due to the longer engagement ranges. However, there is one major problem with using missiles against our alien enemies. They can't hit the bastards.\n"
"\n"
"The amount and density of alien EW systems is enough to defeat the guidance systems of practically any Earth-built missile. Our electronics are simply not up to the job. The aliens make short work of radar and infrared homing, and manually-guided missiles have no chance of hitting. Even laser-riding missiles can't maintain a lock on the alien hull materials. This leaves us without a lot of options in the field of guided ordnance.\n"
"\n"
"It's only thanks to the extensive knowledge and experience of my staff that we've found one.\n"
"\n"
"The \"Sparrowhawk\" missile is an antique that never quite got out of the prototype stage. It was first tested in 2019, using then-revolutionary digital imaging technology to improve the old guidance technology of 'contrast seeking'. This technique uses an array of optical cameras mounted in the transparent fibreglass nose of the missile. The onboard computer looks for a spot in the image where the contrast changes the fastest, and then attempts to keep that spot dead centre in front of it. This system has been employed mostly in air-to-ground missiles due to the greater effectiveness of other guidance systems against Earth-built aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk program was cancelled only months before the design would've been put into service. It was ready to be put into service then, it's ready now, and right now it's the only choice we've got.\n"
"\n"
"We've revived the Sparrowhawk AA program and the UN has agreed to put it into mass production. This will give us access to 7-missile racks capable of being mounted on all our interceptors, allowing them to engage UFOs at ranges that would otherwise be closed off to us.\n"
"\n"
"The missile's maximum effective range is twelve kilometres. A fully-loaded \"Sparrowhawk\" rack weighs approximately 600 kilos.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Sparrowhawk should be an essential part of our aerial defence plan. Preferably all our interceptors would be carrying at least one full rack at launch. The ability to soften up an enemy while we close in is something not to be ignored lightly. Overall accuracy will be poor -- we estimate approximately one hit in twelve -- but the range difference is one of miles.\n"
"\n"
"Compared to the TR-20 rocket pod, the Sparrowhawk's effective range is greater by eight kilometres. Compared the SHIVA cannon, it's greater by ten kilometres. While these deliver a lot more damage than the Sparrowhawk at their respective ranges, the closer we have to get to attack the enemy, the greater the danger to our pilots and interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"It should theoretically be possible to simply overwhelm UFOs with Sparrowhawk fire if we could field enough aircraft armed with them. However, our Director of Finances has expressed her extreme displeasure with this idea, and I have to admit she's got a point -- but I think it's something we should keep in mind if we come up against a particularly dangerous UFO that needs to be taken out at range and as quickly as possible.\n"

"\n"
"The TR-20 rocket pod is an interesting departure from conventional air-to-air weapons, in that it was originally designed for air-to-ground operations. The pod contains a total of 152 very small, very fast rockets with depleted uranium tips and powerful pulse detonation engines. No one considered using the TR-20 for anything other than chewing up ground targets until an attack helicopter pilot in Africa discovered their potential.\n"
"\n"
"At the time, the pilot -- the last surviving member of his flight -- had been cornered against a mountain by three MiG jets which were closing in for the kill. With nearly all his weapons expended, the only thing the pilot had left to fight with was one pod of TR-20 rockets. He made a suicide run with full afterburners, and managed to swat all three MiGs out of the sky with rapid fire before he ran out of fuel and had to crash-land. He returned to his airbase two days later without a scratch on him.\n"
"\n"
"Though unguided, TR-20 pods contain such a large number of rockets that they can be used almost like a rocket machine gun. This is because the rockets are stacked nose to tail inside their launch tubes, eight to each tube, and fired electronically in a timed sequence. This system is so fast that all eight rockets in a tube can be ignited and underway before the first rocket actually leaves the tube. At its maximum possible rate of fire, the pod can fire all 152 rockets in 0.2 seconds. However, this is usually throttled back to approx. 300 rounds per minute due to the low accuracy of any single volley.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of the TR-20 over the SHIVA cannon are increased range and greater hitting power. However, the pod's ammo capacity is limited compared to the SHIVA's large portable magazines, and a single TR-20 pod is unlikely to last through a full UFO engagement.\n"
"\n"

"We anticipate the TR-20 will perform nicely against slower or slow-moving UFOs, especially if their propulsion systems have been damaged somehow.

Damage potential is irrelevant if we can't place a single round on the target.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, it's recommended we use the TR-20 in moderation and mostly in situations that play to its strengths, such as when engaging a single UFO with multiple aircraft. The flight leader can drive the target into his wingman's killzone with cannons or guided weapons, at which point the wingman has a clear shot with his rockets. Even so, no more than a single TR-20 pod should be loaded on any one aircraft for maximum air-to-air efficiency.\n"

"Our report on the alien PBW (Particle Beam Weapon) is ready for your review, Commander.\n"
"\n"
"The general idea of particle-beam weaponry is to hit a target object with a stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore carrying tremendous kinetic energy. The alien weapon is an elegantly simple application of this concept. It is essentially nothing more than a big particle accelerator and a set of focusing equipment, consisting of a high-powered magnetic containment and pinch system.\n"
"\n"
"My team could've built a particle accelerator to nearly the same standards, but the focusing array shows us just how far ahead the aliens really are. The accelerator is little more than a high-energy synchrotron, speeding particles round and round in a circle until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam. The level of magnetic control the aliens achieve here is far greater than anything we've managed before. The pinch system is intelligently controlled by the UFO's targeting computer, directing the beam to its target with dead-on accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"When active, the weapon is powered directly from the UFO's electrical system, constantly tracking one target of choice. Once the target has been destroyed, the computer will immediately lock on to the next hostile contact in the chain, if any.\n"
"\n"
"Defending against this weapon is going to be a challenge, Commander. There is very little that can be done against a particle beam travelling at near the speed of light, carrying enough energy to knock anything we can field right out of the sky. Additional armour for our aircraft will protect against glancing blows, but in the case of a direct hit, it may as well not be there. It seems the only realistic defence against this weapon is to cause it to miss. We should recover and investigate an intact alien ECM unit as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"It will be a similar challenge for us to fit the PBW to our own craft. We've rigged up brackets that we can mount to any medium-sized hardpoint, but we can't generate enough power to suit this weapon just from in-flight electricity. If we want to use the PBW in combat, we're going to have to run it off its own antimatter-powered electrical system. This may require more research into antimatter storage and control, and it means that ammunition will certainly be limited.\n"
"\n"
"On a brighter note, we've confirmed that all the weapon's components are within our ability to replicate, and their specs have been loaded into our Workshop machinery. We should be able to begin production straight away.\n"

"Kommendör, Jag tror vi har hittat hemligheten till de utomjordiska materialen. Efter vi gjort några modifikationer på våra maskiner i verkstäderna så har vi nu lyckats använda materialet och 'programmera' det till nya avancerade former.\n"
"\n"
"Som jag nämde tidigare, det utomjordiska materialet bildar ett så kallad 'legerings minne' som kommer ihåg flera former som den kan förvandla sig till om materialet får rätt stimulans. Otroligt nog så kan den utomjordiska legeringen bli stimulerad av två olika saker: värme och elektricitet. Värme är det naturliga valet när UFOts flygplanskropp breder ut sig i atmosfärisk flygning för att få bättre lyftkraft. Elektricitet är dock nytt.\n"
"\n"
"När man använder elektricitet svarar legeringen endast på en konstant, lågvolts spänning vid speciella ampere. Materialets form komer ändras och stanna i denna form så länge denna spänning är bibehållen. När spänningen stängs av kommer materialet att gå tillbaka till sin ursprungliga 'vilo' form eller en värme orsakad form om tillräcklig värme finns tillgänglig. En elekricitet orsakad form kommer ha företräde framför en värme orsakad form.\n"
"\n"
"Med detta menas att formen av ett UFOs flygplanskropp (och allt annat gjort av detta material) kan ändras efter behag, antingen av order från operatören eller av automatiserad elektronik.\n"

"Utomjordiska material är nu tillgängliga för användning i produktion. Olyckligtvis behöver de en massa ovanliga och dyra komponenter, där några kan hittas på jorden i väldigt små mängder. Det går inte på något sätt att komma över de material i de mängder som behövs för att göra produktion möjlig.

"\n"
"In the first decade of the 21st, the Middle-East was the greatest concern of nations around the world. Tensions increased when Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan formed the Middle-Eastern alliance, a political body to unite the Islamic world. Soon after, democratic elections in Iraq caused the United States to lose control of the country, and Iraq joined the Middle-Eastern Alliance along with Pakistan and Lebanon later that year. In a panic, Israel threw in its lot with the expanding European Union, thus forcing itself to abide by increasingly strict EU laws on human rights and warfare. Its military presence in the region was significantly reduced over the years as a result.\n"

"However, as 2009 turned into 2010, attentions turned away from the Middle-East as the increasingly bold power grabs by China started to make waves. The People's Republic had been nibbling away at its neighbours for several years, but in December of 2010, after decades of harsh words and grim promises, Taiwan was finally conquered by a full-scale Chinese military invasion. The UN gave several sternly-worded reprimands which were summarily ignored. The international community debated the issue at length, and did nothing.\n"

"The Second Cold War between the old United States and China began when China annexed North and South Korea in 2012, after secret agents managed to disable North Korea's entire nuclear arsenal for the length of the three-day invasion. The well-trained and equipped People's Army vastly outnumbered the Korean divisions; they occupied both countries long before the Koreans could even begin to receive aid from overseas. The move drew even more ire from the UN and cooled diplomatic relations between China and Russia for decades to come.\n"
"\n"
"Tensions around the world remained high during the length of the Second Cold War, with rebellions the order of the day in the newly-subjugated Chinese territories, but ultimately neither China nor the US was ready to commit to nuclear annihilation.\n"
"\n"
"The war technically came to an end in 2031, as the US economy crumbled under a crushing military budget and deficit interest rates that exceeded the country's entire gross national product. Meanwhile, having become increasingly liberal during the Cold War years, China took on the mantle of world leader without knowing quite what to do with it. Its leaders perhaps became drunk with power, a little too hungry, a little too proud. Using the army to try and enforce their decision, they attempted to revert the country to the brutal Stalinist oppression of the 20th century. The people did not approve.\n"
"\n"
"The ensuing civil war was like nothing Earth had ever seen. Officers often referred to it as the bastard child of Vietnam and the First World War. It saw firebombing of entire populations, mass executions of prisoners of war, and tactical nuclear strikes on several cities -- including Shanghai, Seoul and New Delhi -- on 7 June 2034. Government loyalists dropped a total of six 50-kiloton devices on heavily-defended rebel positions, including the civilian populations the rebels were protecting.\n"
"\n"
"The loyalist army suffered massive desertions in the days that followed; it was the single event that eventually spelled doom for the government. More than six million lives were lost before the surrender of loyalist forces on 15 August 2036, having fought tooth and nail and employed large-scale scorched earth tactics as the rebels slowly drove them into the Indian Ocean. This is the official ending of the Second Cold War."

"\n"
"In the years that followed, the reformed Republic of China -- taking up its old, pre-Communist name -- slowly relinquished its conquered territories, including those seized in centuries past, offering them a choice between independence or a seat on the new governmental council as an equal and respected part of the new Republic. Having fought on the rebel side throughout the civil war, Taiwan was the first to merge with the new Republic, reconciling its differences with the mainland after the Communist government surrendered. Taiwan quickly became a major player in the new council and was instrumental in sending the captured government leaders off to The Hague to face a war crimes tribunal. North Korea, another rebel nation, also elected to remain in the Republic, sensing opportunities for greater economic growth and freedom from dictatorship. They would not be disappointed.\n"
"\n"
"The resurgence of the Chinese economy was dubbed a miracle by contemporary historians. The first breakthroughs in nanotechnology were made by Chinese researchers, bringing in vast medical-industrial contracts from all over the world. Despite old hatreds and mistrust, other east-Asian nations slowly joined the Republic, which was soon redubbed the Asian Republic to honour its new members. Even Japan eventually joined to bolster its flagging economy and a population which had dwindled through the war years. The Republic continued mostly true to its principles with the civil war still fresh in mind. Over the years it made a reputation for dealing with all its member nations in good faith, and built enough trust and solidarity that it can now speak with a single voice for all the billions of people of south-east Asia.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Asian Republic's economy has all but recovered due to the commercialisation of nanotech and holographics. It still possesses a strong and up-to-date military, trained to a higher standard than any other country.\n"

"Revolutionärsländerna:\n"
"\n"
"With the successive fall of both the United States and China, Socialism in South-America waxed and waned during the post-war years. The US's economic death brought on a surge of revolutionary fervor, swaying several nations away from the influence of capitalism. However, with a democratic framework already halfway in place in most countries, the ideal of rule of the people could for the first time be realised without corruption. This new wave proposed to unite the principles of democracy with true Socialist ideals.\n"
"\n"
"The whole continent watched in horror at the nuking of Shanghai during the Second Cold War, televised all over the globe right up to the final second. The new wave suffered another major blow when China fell. In that, everyone could see a first-hand example of what might happen to the revolution if it went the way of dictatorship and totalitarianism. It didn't take long for the leaders to respond.\n"
"\n"
"Several dictator-led countries immediately tried to turn on the thumbscrews, trying to head off a rebellion before it began, which caused a huge backlash in the larger democratic nations, particularly Cuba, Brazil and Argentina. Suddenly, the last remaining kings of South-America were left with no friends at all.\n"
"\n"
"One by one, they caved to public and political pressure and were replaced by elected houses. The revolution picked up speed instead of losing it; they encouraged greater trade, closer integration, and eventually followed Europe's example of open borders. A new network of highways all over the continent strengthened economies and allowed far more efficient use of arable land. South-America's natural riches were tapped like never before, and they demanded fair prices for every bit of it.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the member nations have merged so closely that they are better known as a single body: the Revolutionary Countries. One joint government represents the entire continent, and they manage an economical juggernaut surpassed only by the Greater European Union. Their military is small but has state-of-the-art equipment. Their training is not exceptional.\n"
"\n"

"Förenade Amerika:\n"
"\n"
"As the US economy started to break down in the late 2020s, more and more people abandoned the country for the greener pastures of Canada and, ironically, Mexico. The value of the dollar plummeted to unprecedented depths, impoverishing millions until its price was fixed by the IMF and the international banking community. The country was then saddled with a brutal reform plan, requiring it to sell off or mothball over half of its military arsenal. To cope with the repayment on sixteen trillion dollars of debt, its interest rate was frozen and its exports shifted to technology and luxury goods. Successful restructuring of NASA, combined with a functional spaceplane prototype, also turned outer space into a money-maker for the post-collapse US. Cape Canaveral began offering the cheapest space launches anywhere on the planet, first with their prototype, later with fully-functional advanced spaceplane designs. This significantly helped the beleaguered country claw its way back towards the black.\n"
"\n"
"The cooperation between North-American nations began with financial aid from Canada and Mexico, which saw their exports to the US dipping dangerously and wanted to help fix their most important trading partner. The growing number of expatriates also served to create closer ties. Then, in the most unexpected political turnaround in 2042, Mexico elected the US expatriate Esteban Villa-Lobos Garcia to the office of president.\n"
"\n"
"The election was hotly contested. However, the decision held through two recounts, and the new president was inaugurated in July of 2042. Eventually, a combination of sound policies and personal charisma brought most of the country around on Garcia; and then he proposed the Tomorrow Plan.\n"
"\n"
"Under the plan, Mexico, Canada and the USA would unite into one country to reawaken the North American superpower. In a number of controversial public votes, the general population in all three countries gave majority support for the Tomorrow Plan; 52% in the United States, 64% in Canada, and 71% in Mexico. The merger was eventually finalised in 2050, creating a United America out of the dominant powers of the New World. The booming space industry quickly spread throughout the new country, and despite a few stumbles along the way, North America steamed headlong towards recovery.\n"
"\n"
"Today, UA's debt has decreased from sixteen trillion to two, and standards of living have nearly recovered to what they were before the crash. UA has the most advanced space industry on the planet; NASA performs almost 70% of commercial space launches around the globe. It exports vast quantities of goods to every other nation and is projected to return to solvency in less than three years. Militarily, the UA is the weakest of all the meganations. It has only a small volunteer army and a tiny defence budget as mandated by the IMF. However, what forces the UA does have are highly-trained and can turn on a dime, able to reach any place in the country within two hours.\n"

"Storeuropeiska gemenskapen:\n"
"\n"
"Slowly but surely, the European Union has expanded borders further and further with every passing decade. It first moved into the Middle-East when it accepted Israel as an associate member in 2011, and then upgraded both Israel and Turkey to full membership in 2017. Several Atlantic islands were also accepted in the same resolution, making it the single greatest EU expansion of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"Following Israel's controversial entrance as an associate member, the EU passed stricter laws on human rights, freedom of religion and separation of church and state. It was also the first Western superpower to officially recognise the Middle-Eastern Alliance, and fostered close relations with the Alliance -- despite United States protests -- in the hope of reducing culture clash and the ongoing threat of terrorism. For the most part, they were successful.\n"
"\n"
"In 2028, Greenland -- having grown strong due to immigration from the United States -- formally declared its independence from Denmark. No battles were fought; the Danish government grudgingly recognised the independence due to political pressure from other European countries. In the following months, Greenland briefly considered joining the US as a protectorate, but reconsidered when the EU offered a full membership. This, along with the defection of several US island protectorates in the Atlantic, impelled the EU to rename itself the 'Greater European Union'.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the Second Cold War, the GEU has always been on the forefront of political development. It was the only Western nation to second the Middle-Eastern Alliance's vote of no confidence on the old United Nations, after the UN's complete failure to act during the Chinese expansion and eventual civil war. The GEU also strongly supported the Alliance's efforts to create a new UN, providing fair representation to all the world's nations, and with enough teeth to live up to the principles under which it was first created.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the GEU is the strongest economical and political force in the world. However, its vast bureaucracy and large number of members -- members who don't always see eye-to-eye -- make it slow to manoeuvre in every way. Its military is large and powerful but poorly-integrated, with each individual army sticking to the language and traditions of their country. Military cooperation is difficult to achieve and requires going through huge amounts of red tape. The GEU contributes a majority of UN troops, but they are only ever used as peacekepeers. Whether or not the GEU militaries have lost their 'edge' has been a subject of hot debate in Brussels for many years, and there appears to be no decision in sight.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"Mellanösternalliansen:\n"
"\n"
"The rise of the Middle-Eastern Alliance was a surprise to everyone, including the people involved. It was designed solely to weaken Western influence in the Middle-East. The principal designers and first members -- Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan -- never meant the Alliance to last more than a decade, by which time they expected it to fragment and disband under the weight of its own differences.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War changed everything. The People's Republic of China was no longer a nearby ally against the West; it became an expanding threat with an appetite, casting hungry eyes on Nepal, chunks of India, and possibly even the sovereign states on China's western border. Pakistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan rushed into the arms of the Alliance in order to guard themselves against invasion. The Arabian subcontinent joined the Alliance not a year later, seeking to expand their political pull with the West. Without even realising it, they had formed a power block covering nearly the entire Middle-East. Their position was simply too good to allow it to crumble.\n"
"\n"
"The expanded Alliance, now recognised by the European Union, stepped onto the international stage with knife in hand. They had a stranglehold on most of the world's remaining oil supplies and the will to exploit it.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance's economic power grew as outside oil reserves dwindled. Pharmaceutical manufacturers packed up in droves and moved to the Middle-East, the only place left in the world where oil was cheap and plentiful. This, along with the many other applications of crude oil, allowed the Middle-East to survive the Russian 'nuclear revolution' and the subsequent worldwide migration to nuclear power. It continued its expansion with Egypt, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and disputed chunks of Africa around the Red Sea. The entire Red Sea region was quickly pacified when the Alliance moved in its military to assist the new African members.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the spread of prosperity has turned the Middle-East away from dogma and towards secular law and gender equality. It is still ruled by individuals -- Sultans, Emirs, Maliks, Presidents and Generals -- but their personal power is kept in check by the rest of the Alliance, rulers who do not want their colleagues stepping out of line. Political dissent is tolerated due to pressure from the EU and other nations, but even in 2084 few of the Alliance's member nations have a functioning democratic process.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance military is large, fast and mean. It is one of the most elite and well-equipped forces in the world, and it uses more permissive rules of engagement than either United America or the Asian Republic. Their clause for 'acceptable civilian casualties' has been the source of huge amounts of criticism from across the world, but the Alliance has stubbornly maintained this clause throughout the four decades it has been in effect.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Nya Afrika:\n"
"\n"
"Born out of violence and strife, New Africa found its unification in separation. It languished onwards for three decades into the 21st century, as it had done for far too long, with its civil wars and ethnic purges and atrocities beyond measure. That is, until several central-African nations undertook a massive project in 2039 to break the notorious diamond cartels and seize their revenue for long-term national improvement.\n"
"\n"
"It resulted in a military and economic bloodbath. The UN attempted various measures to stop the fighting but, even more toothless than ever before, it accomplished nothing. However, the league of nations was eventually joined by several others, tired of being pushed around by Western conglomerates, and after several years of bitter fighting they were successful in taking down the cartels one by one. This left them with some of the largest, most advanced diamond and gold mines in the world; it made their combined territory the largest single supplier of natural diamonds in the world. It also gave them a new sense of what they could accomplish together. The core of New Africa was born.\n"
"\n"
"All the African nations involved in the anti-cartel war, with the exception of territories loyal to the Commonwealth of Oceania and the Middle-Eastern Alliance, began to work much more closely together, taking cues from South-America in building a dependable road network to fuel trade and communication. It also allowed a much better distribution of food. Over the next thirty years, New Africa completely eliminated famine within its borders, which it changed completely to accomodate ethnicity and a desire for independence within its territories, and brought socialised public health-care to its people at near-ruinous cost. However, it also found new exports in the commercialised, sustainable growth of tropical hardwood and exotic fruit. The new cooperation made price agreements across the continent possible for the first time; like the Revolutionary Countries, New Africa forced the rest of the world to pay fairly for all goods and services.\n"
"\n"
"Today, New Africa is still the weakest of the great powers economically, but it is growing fast. It has a large, motivated standing army, but the troops are not well-equipped, armed mostly with former US antiques and even century-old Soviet equipment. They also have trouble getting to remote locations due to frequent equipment failures and the continent's difficult geography. Most of the time, the best the New Africans can do is spot UFOs as they land with one of thousands of scouts and small patrols out in the country to combat poaching and smuggling.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Ryssland:\n"
"\n"
"Russia took decades to recover from the fall of the Soviet Union and the ravages of the Soviet system on the country's economy. It festered like an open wound for the first half of the 21st century, still trying to quash the constant rebellions in Chechnya, still trying to reform after 70 years of state domination, still trying to get back its lost position as a world superpower.\n"
"\n"
"Things finally started getting better for Russia when then-prime minister Yevgeny Karamazov granted complete independence to Chechnya in 2047. While the newly official Chechen Republic imploded in a storm of violence about who exactly should rule, Russia turned away and set itself to fixing its own problems, leaving Chechnya to itself -- and to the new and improved UN, which immediately took an interest in trying to stop the bloodshed. Unfortunately that wouldn't happen for a long time, and even then Chechnya could only return to Russia's sphere of influence, but for the first time it did so as a fully-recognised independent voice.\n"
"\n"
"Economic salvation for Russia -- especially with oil supplies from the Middle-East dwindling -- began with drilling the country's own oil in Siberia, with new techniques and equipment able to survive the harsh winter conditions, and later with the construction of a series of new nuclear power plants. Russia invested heavily in research to make the new plants smaller, safer and -- more importantly -- sustainable. This involved a switch from enriched uranium to thorium as the main nuclear fuel for all the new Russian plants, and advanced new designs based upon the 'energy amplifier', a new type of fission reactor first test-built near Rome from 2004 to 2011. Two of the new reactors even consumed plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons and from the stored waste of older power plants.\n"
"\n"
"Then, eight years after the Chechen independence, Russia's 'nuclear revolution' really came into its own with the invention of the depleted element postprocessor, which could convert 90% of an energy amplifier's waste into radiation-free elements in weeks instead of centuries. The Russians ended the age-old energy crisis almost overnight; nuclear fission became safe, relatively clean, and global thorium supplies would see the world clear into the year 3000.\n"
"\n"
"Today, many of the ex-Soviet republics have rejoined Russia, following the example of the other great nations, eager to take advantage of the power generation and nuclear technology that are now Russia's main exports. The nuclear revolution continues even today with the gradual development and commercialisation of fusion power. Though its economy is still troubled, the country is now in better shape than it has been for centuries -- whether under the khans, the czars or the Soviets. Its military is somewhat antiquated but highly-trained, well-disciplined and professional, and it does not lack for manpower.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Samfälligheten Oceanien:\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Nations, a political organisation made up of most of the countries of the old British Empire, lost a great deal of power going into the Second Cold War. First, Pakistan cut its ties to the Commonwealth when joining the Middle-Eastern Alliance. Then, as the United States crashed and burned, Britain and Canada became more and more concerned with their own parts of the world and let their participation dwindle to nothing. By 2030, they were members in name only.\n"
"\n"
"The growing power of China throughout the war caused a huge expansion in military budgets for India and Australia, budgets which their economies had trouble supporting. Then, in 2035, India became one more battlefield in the Chinese civil war. Veteran government troops easily defeated the Indian military in several short but bloody engagements and seized most of the country while the rebels pursued.\n"
"\n"
"Australia pledged a full-scale military intervention along with several South-African Commonwealth members. After weeks of brutal fighting, the Australian divisions managed to link up with Chinese rebel forces and the surviving regiments of the Indian army, and together they nearly annihilated the governmental army before the surrender in 2036.\n"
"\n"
"The cost was high. The conquered parts of India were a wasteland, the country had no government left after the nuking of New Delhi, and famines were already starting to grip the population. It began ceding worthless parts of land to other nations and gave independence to several small regions along its border. The remaining Commonwealth nations undertook the vast task of reconstructing India, though many abandoned the project and the Commonwealth in favour of the other growing superpowers.\n"
"\n"
"The reconstruction of India eventually united the Commonwealth into one great nation, taking advantage of their geographic location around the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific to charge strategic tariffs for ships passing through their waters. Commonwealth shipping, on the other hand, was free from tariffs and quickly rose to dominance in the competitive market. Later, with the breaking of the diamond cartels in Africa, the Commonwealth seized several leaderless mines inside its borders and used them to their full potential.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Commonwealth of Nations is better known as the 'Commonwealth of Oceania' or just 'Oceania'. Since its inception it has accepted several non-Commonwealth countries into its midst, notably Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Indonesia, extending its control over the Oceanian waters. While it still can't compete economically with the richer nations, it has carved out its own niche, and is quite happy to go on prospering in it.\n"
"\n"
"Oceania's military consists mainly of a powerful navy. Its land army is minuscule compared to that of any nation except United America, and serves only in a defensive capacity, with average training and equipment. However, it can respond fairly quickly in emergency situations."

"\"Project PHALANX\" was first conceived by the United States Department of Defense in 1955, after years of growing concern over increased numbers of UFO sightings all across the world. The possibility of an alien invasion plagued badly on the minds of politicians already unnerved by the nuclear power of the Soviet Union. The existence of hostile extraterrestrial life in the universe seemed a very remote possibility, even moreso that these hostiles might find Earth among all the vastness of space -- but could America afford to take that chance?\n"
"\n"
"The project's proponents spent two years building support among the highest levels of power. Finally, in 1957, PHALANX received its first funding allocation. A significant chunk of the year's 'black budget' went to the construction of an advanced underground complex in the Nevada desert somewhere in the territory of Nellis Air Force Base. The complex was named \"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command\", loaded with state-of-the-art equipment, and staffed with the best and brightest to hammer out how best to combat an extraterrestrial incursion into US soil.\n"
"\n"
"The project was a rousing success in its formative years, developing ground-breaking technologies and producing working prototypes of things the world had never seen before, all for a fraction of the costs that civilian contractors would run up. Due to its very nature, PHALANX was the subject of yearly budget battles, but its R&D successes always gave the project a reason to continue even for the most hardline practicalists.\n"
"\n"
"However, the world moved on while PHALANX kept preparing for something that never happened. The Vietnam war saw a tremendous upsurge in military spending, almost none of which was allocated to PHALANX or similar projects, who saw their own budgets slashed and burned in the face of war. Despite repeated requests for more funding, the Joint Chiefs dismissed the outlandish 1950s program as 'pie-in-the-sky' spending and let it continue only because of its research efforts. Most of the remaining funding went to keep old equipment serviced and the labs running, if only barely.\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX never quite recovered after the war. They would never again have the budgets they had in the '50s; the glory years were over. They supplied some new technology used in the Gulf War, and experienced brief uptick during the opening years of the 21st century due to soaring US military budgets, but after these brief spurts of creativity the project would again fade into obscurity.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War drained away the last life left in the project. Its commanders struggled to keep it going without even the money to keep their aircraft in the sky, but even the invention of artificial spider silk couldn't save them from the United States' crashing economy. The country's slide into ruin necked every 'non-essential' military program in the country, one by one, and PHALANX was finally stricken from the budget in 2027. It was five months away from its 70th anniversary. The staff was dismissed, the base dismantled, the unique equipment mothballed and thrown into storage. The project was quickly forgotten.\n"
"\n"
"Until it was rediscovered on 9 March 2084 by an old man who remembered reading about it in a dusty file in his long-demolished office.\n"
"\n"
"The horror and enormity of the events in Mumbai shocked the world. The existence of intelligent alien life in the universe was no longer a matter of faith. Not only did it exist, it had made contact in the worst way. The massacres were too large and visible for Earth's governments to keep them secret. Video evidence of the smoking, blood-stained streets aired on television sets around the world. The aliens had left no other evidence of their visit; they diligently recovered their dead and collected every scrap of dropped technology before pulling out.\n"
"\n"
"Panic spread like wildfire in the wake of the Mumbai broadcasts, and things got worse as word reached the general public about the slaughter in Bonn, Johannesburg and Bangkok. The world knew it had been visited, and now it began to realise it was under attack.\n"
"\n"
"The quest for solutions was frantic. The United Nations remained in session continuously for over a week. Plans were drawn up and burnt down with lightning speed. The world was completely defenceless against an alien invasion, both militarily and psychologically. No one had prepared for this. It was one of the forgotten doomsday scenarios that sat crumbling to dust in the back closet of some strategic planning office, unread and unheeded. Now, however, the public demanded answers that no one knew, action that no one could provide.\n"
"\n"
"The UN could agree only on a few token gestures; at the order of the Security Council, NASA evacuated International Space Stations 1 and 2, as well as the permanent colony on the moon. The entire range of planned missions to Mars was stricken from the calendar. On all the matters that counted, the UN was deadlocked. Some nations wanted to build massive orbital defences while others insisted they should be permitted to use nuclear missiles for UFO interception. Still others had even more outlandish projects to push. The situation grew worse as the days wore on, until one aging diplomat remembered the PHALANX project.\n"
"\n"
"With full access to the old US files, the UN was shocked to find plans, designs, equipment and training manuals; a fully-detailed response to an invasion scenario. They immediately decided to revive PHALANX and equip it to defend Earth from the alien threat. However, everyone who was once a part of PHALANX was either dead or dying. They were going to need a new staff.\n"
"\n"
"By unanimous vote, it was decided to keep the project as secret as possible, known only to the highest-ranking politicians and military commanders in the world. The public was comforted with smokescreens and sweet lies while a hand-picked team of operatives from all over the world struggled to resurrect PHALANX and whip it back into fighting trim. Old equipment was tracked down and recovered from gutted warehouses, crumbling manuals were dusted off, and stockpiles of weapons were reassembled for use. With the secret backing of all eight great powers, the project had funding, support and the men it needed to go to war.\n"
"\n"
"All it lacked was a leader."

"\n"
"Ny information har kommit upp under den senaste serien av obduktioner du begärde. Våra rapporter kvarstår, men vi har upptäckt en gemensamhet som ger oss en ny insikt om utomjordingarnas mångfalld.\n"
"\n"
"Under våra första analyser av utomjordingarnas cellstruktur, så träffade vi på några avvikelser där våra DNA kopierings tester skulle misslyckas pga oförklarlig kontaminering av prover. Vi förkastade det först att vara ett mänskligt fel, men problemen har fortsatt att visa sig med en överraskande regelbundenhet. Samma resultat, om och om igen, varje gång vi testat ett prov som inte har blivit lagrat genom kryofrysning så har vi haft svårighet att ta ut en enskild okontaminerad sekvens. Jag har spenderat några av mina lediga timmar att studera problemet, och jag tror jag har funnit orsaken.\n"
"\n"
"Den enklaste förklaringen är detta: Det är två typer av DNA i våra blodprover. Det främmande DNA: ts förekommst är total; denna sekvens kan hittas i alla medlemmar av Tamanrasen, och en närmare studie har bekräftat att en liknande sekvens finns i blodet på andra raser vi hittat. Källan verkar vara en sorts encellig organism som finns i stor mängd i det utomjordiska blodomloppet. Det finns flera olika versioner av den, en för varje utomjordisk ras, och alla delar otroliga DNA likheter. Intressant nog så även om alla dessa organismer har lika många kromosomer, så kan ingen av dom överleva i en kropp som inte är medlem av den ursprungliga rasen. Underligt nog så är det helt klart att det är absolut ingen som helst variation på DNA: t mellan organismer från samma version. Detta leder till att vi tror att olika versioner kan ha tillverkats -- helt eller delvis -- för att passa den individuella rasen.\n"
"\n"
"Vi antar att alla utomjordingar bär en version av denna micro organisms infektion. Organismens funktion är inte helt klar. Vi har gjort tester på olika experimentella vävnads prover, både infekterade och kontrollprover. Den infekterade vävnaden verkar inte lida av några negativa effekter -- eller positiva heller för den delen -- av organismens närvaro. De är i stort sätt oskiljbara från oinfekterad vävnad. Då organismen kräver en levande värd för sin egna överlevnad, så verkar det inte vara en parasit eller en symbiot, med för närvarande obemärkta fördelar.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Vi har namngett denna organism XVI (EXtraterrestrial Virus Infektion). Detta kan vara en felbeteckning i microbiologiska termer; XVI är långt mer komplicerad än något virus på jorden, men den beter och kopierar sig precis som ett vanligt virus. Därför känner vi att termen är försvarbar. När varje utomjordisk ras bär en unik sträng av infektionen, så har vi gett dem ett alfabetiskt designering efter den ursprungliga ras som strängen hittas i. Tamanerna har XVI-T, Shevaar har XVI-S, osv.\n"
"\n"
"Infektionens syfte kvarstår suddig just nu, men det är det enda vi har hittat än så länge som binder ihop dessa olika raser fysiskt. Vi kan bara gissa att olika strängar av infektionen skapades för att passa varje ras.\n"
"\n"
"Det finns ingen indikation att denna organism är smittsam för oss människor. När vi injicerar odlingar av männsklig vävnad med färskt utomjordiskt blod så har vi observerat att det utomjordiska blodet har blivit totalt utstött, som väntat. Oväntat nog, så har allt spår av infektionen därefter förintats av vanliga männskliga T celler. Organismen kunde inte slå av vårat immunförsvar för att kunna slå rot.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"New information has come to light during the last batch of autopsies you requested. Our reports stand, but we've discovered a commonality that may give us some new insight into the aliens' diversity.\n"
"\n"
"During our first analyses of the aliens' cellular structure, we encountered some anomalies where our DNA replication tests would fail due to unexplained sample contamination. We initially discarded this as human error, but the problem has continued to appear with surprising regularity. The same result, again and again; every time we run a sample that hasn't been cryofrozen for storage, we have difficulty extracting a single uncontaminated sequence. I spent some of my off hours studying the problem, and I believe I've found the cause.\n"
"\n"
"The simplest explanation is this: There are two types of DNA present in our blood samples. The foreign DNA's prevalence is total; these sequences can be found in every member of the Taman species, and closer study has confirmed that similar sequences exist in the blood of other species we've recovered. The source seems to be a kind of single-cellular organism present in huge numbers in the alien bloodstream. There are several versions of it, one for each species of alien, and they all share remarkable DNA similarities. Interestingly, although these organisms all have an identical number of chromosomes, none of them can survive in a body that is not a member of its source species. Also curious is the fact that there are absolutely no variations in DNA between organisms of the same version. This leads us to believe that the different versions may have been engineered -- wholly or in part -- to suit the individual species.\n"
"\n"
"We now surmise that all aliens carry a version of this micro-organic infection. The organism's function is not readily apparent. We've run tests on various experimental tissue samples, both infected and control specimens. The infected tissues do not appear to suffer any negative effects -- or positive ones, for that matter -- from the organism's presence. They are essentially indistinguishable from uninfected tissues. Since the organism requires a living host for its own survival, it seems to be either a parasite or a symbiote with currently unobserved benefits.\n"
"\n"
"We have dubbed this organism the EXtraterrestrial Viral Infection, or XVI. This may be somewhat of a misnomer in microbiological terms; XVI is far more complex than any terrestrial virus, but it acts and replicates exactly like one. Therefore we feel the term is warranted. As each alien species carries a unique strand of the infection, we have given them alphabetical designations after the source species in which the strand can be found. Tamans have XVI-T, Shevaar have XVI-S, and so forth.\n"
"\n"
"The infection's purpose remains nebulous at this point, but it is the only thing we've found so far that binds these diverse races together physically. We can only assume that new strands of the infection were engineered to suit each species.\n"
"\n"
"There is no indication that this organism is contagious for humans. When injecting cultures of human tissue with fresh alien blood, we have observed the alien blood being completely rejected, as expected. Unexpectedly, however, any trace of the infection was subsequently annihilated by standard human T cells. The organism was unable to deactivate our immune system in order to take root.\n"
"\n"
"We currently do not believe the XVI organism poses a threat to our soldiers on the battlefield. However, we will continue research and keep you updated about any developments. A thorough blood screening of all our personnel is in progress, just in case, and standard quarantine procedures will be maintained throughout the lab.\n"

"My team and I are deeply troubled by the recent reports of human hostility against PHALANX personnel, as I'm sure you are. We've all seen the battlefield footage. There's no doubt that the attackers were humans like you and me, but it's also clear they were using alien weaponry and equipment -- some of which even PHALANX has never seen before.\n"
"\n"
"The worrying questions seem to mount up. First, however, we need to review the facts we have.\n"
"\n"
"Do the aliens have active sympathisers on Earth? Yes.\n"
"\n"
"Are the aliens supplying these human servants? Most likely, it's the only reasonable explanation for their advanced alien equipment.\n"
"\n"
"Do the servants present a threat? Absolutely. Perhaps a greater one than the alien menace itself.\n"
"\n"
"We need to delve deeper into what makes these people tick. If we can find out the most common causes for alien infiltration, our Information Division should be able to devise a far more successful propaganda strategy, which could increase our number of volunteers as well as decrease the alien infiltration rate across the globe. DivBio also has a stake; we'd like to examine at least one live human prisoner in our Containment unit so we can run a full physical examination. If the aliens have bodily altered these people in addition to training and supplying them, we'd like to find out about it.\n"
"\n"
"Director Wong (DivInfo) reports that if we hold off too long on implementing a new info strategy, we could soon face recruitment shortfalls and increased human resistance as the sympathisers begin to grow. I tend to agree. We need to keep this planet together if we are to have any chance against the alien threat.\n"

"\n"
"You need to read this right away. By your request, we've performed several hurried autopsies and done our best to examine the live prisoners taken on our mission against the alien sympathisers. The results are alarming.\n"
"\n"
"Do you remember the report I sent you about the first live alien specimen we researched? As you may remember, it had lost all its intellect and became largely unresponsive without fellows to empower the hive mind. Prepare yourself, Commander: The human prisoner in our Containment unit exhibits the very same symptoms. A thorough blood analysis has produced conclusive evidence that the prisoner is infected with an XVI strand.\n"
"\n"
"This new strand is slightly different from the others we've encountered, and we fear it can only be designated \"XVI-H\". It appears to be willfully designed to infect humans with the alien hive mind. It overrides their own rational thought processes and replaces them with a direct link into the group, whether there actually is a group or not, through a process we currently fail to understand. Our subjects run the gamut of the human race; the infection seems to have no preference for IQ or physical potential. The infection method appears to be a direct injection of infected blood into the victim's bloodstream. It is premeditated and ruthless. Any amount of shared blood is enough for the infection to take root.\n"
"\n"
"Quarantine procedures have been tightened to the absolute maximum, and we're rushing another full batch of tests on all our personnel. Our field agents remain clean, thank God -- just think if we'd gone into a combat zone with soldiers capable of turning on their teammates at any moment! -- but I fear we have found one conclusive result. It's Dr. Eisenhower, our Director of Administration. He's been away on holiday since last week, but we ran an older sample which has now come up positive. We don't know when or how he was subverted or if he even joined PHALANX with honourable intentions, but it's clear he has acted as an alien spy for some weeks. Unfortunately we can't seem to find him at his announced destination. Internal Security has taken charge of his workstation and is in the process of information control.\n"
"\n"
"Things are a bit hectic right now. Dr. Eisenhower's infection implies that other members of a hive mind -- human or alien -- were in close enough proximity to allow him to function at human intelligence. He could have linked up with our subjects in Containment, or a nearby alien cell, or even other infiltrators inside our base. Right now, we don't know, and we most likely never will. We're all frightened in the Bio lab. My assistant has been jumping at shadows all day.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, we must develop a vaccine against XVI-H as soon as possible. The danger of our soldiers and salvage technicians falling victim to the infection in the field is too great to ignore even for a moment. I hereby request your permission to start work on a vaccine immediately. Please, please respond at your earliest convenience.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"The XVI census program has just gone into effect. Weekly rolling tests have commenced this morning, and I've got a full report on our estimated performance levels and operational details.\n"
"\n"
"Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests are performed by existing nursing staff under the supervision of a small police or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will perform the arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for containment and study. Once the aliens figure out this scheme -- I don't think it'll take them long -- the infected people will start avoiding the census, thereby giving us the data we need simply by their absence.\n"
"\n"
"As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"
"\n"
"Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. 99.9% of the planet's population is registered with one national authority or another, but out of ten billion people that still leaves several million unaccounted for. We will be able to extrapolate figures that are accurate to within several thousand heads, but the statistics we generate won't ever be exact. This means the program is less useful for identifying those who have been infected, but still a godsend for keeping track of XVI spread and alien activity on a global basis. After all, we need to know what kind of progress we're making against this new threat.\n"
"\n"
"The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to shoulder the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the equipment and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the reliability of personnel and the validity of the results. The information will be piped directly to our command centre at no charge to us.\n"
"\n"
"The best thing about this program is that we can now keep track of infection levels and how much threat each region is under from XVI. This will work in conjunction with our normal detection methods to warn us where alien activity is worst and allow us to intervene before the situation becomes critical.\n"
"\n"
"Any area where XVI seems to be gaining ground should be posted with additional air patrols, and we should be on the lookout for any attempts by the aliens to solidify their hold on the ground. Alien activity reports in this area should be investigated and responded to with extreme prejudice.\n"

"With these new developments regarding the infection of Earth's civilian population by this alien organism, the need arises for a way to determine the number of infected people in various regions and the rate of spread. Easier said than done, I know, but it may be every bit as important as finding a cure. We can't help anyone if we don't know they're sick.\n"
"\n"
"What I propose to do is to create a long-term rolling census that checks all registered individuals on the entire planet for XVI infection by way of a small blood test. Everyone will be required to submit to this test once a week to make sure they're clean -- more frequently if they fall under suspicion of infection. Samples will only need to be as large as a single drop of blood, taken from a random vein to prevent tampering. Fortunately the XVI organism is large and prevalent enough that we can test these samples on the spot with near-100%-confidence results.\n"
"\n"
"This is going to be a major undertaking that requires careful liaising with the intelligence services of Earth's eight big nations. I've already prepared plans and simulations to demonstrate the operation and effectiveness of this program. With some time and funding, we can convince them of the project's importance and have everything operational in a matter of weeks.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the small UFO we captured. It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward to getting a chance to sink our own hooks into all this lovely technology.\n"
"\n"
"The craft's strange construction has raised a lot of questions for us to answer. Much of the design seems to make little sense when viewed from the ground. However, now that we've managed to look 'under the hood' and test the alien hull materials under laboratory conditions, we have gained a far clearer picture of UFO capabilities. I've made a list of our most important discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, and then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\n"
"\n"
"- We've found no evidence of landing gear or hover ability in this craft, implying that it isn't meant to land. If it loses both engines, it goes down.\n"
"\n"
"- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but even so I nearly had a heart attack when I found out what was in there. The maximum load -- two tenths of a gramme -- could create a blast yield of more than 8 kilotons. By comparison the bomb at Hiroshima was 13 kilotons. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as possible within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to jettison the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on the tank or the containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion represents an extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is that antimatter explosions create little to no radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"- The craft is extremely hard to see with our detection equipment. This is largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of radiation. We've had the most luck with infrared and gamma ray detection, as the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"- The slim design (generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in air) is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. Every gramme of excess matter has been stripped, and the craft moves fast enough to need very little wing surface. The material itself is quite astonishing, part metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a memory alloy, 'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a more compact form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a more comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's far stronger and tougher than anything we've ever known. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"- We have determined the craft to be unarmed, but it's equipped with what appears to be a large suite of sensors contained in the four protrusions around the cockpit. Curiously, it seems to mount no communications equipment whatsoever, but that would defeat its apparent role as a scout. Your guess is as good as ours, sir.\n"
"\n"
"We have dubbed this class of UFO the 'Scout', as that seems to be its purpose here on Earth. It is used primarily as a reconnaissance unit and vanguard to scout the way for heavier craft. Though unarmed, we should shoot these craft down if we are not otherwise engaged, because anything the aliens are up to is bound to be bad for us.\n"

The flechettes are prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in nasty wounds that will either kill the target or send it running for cover.\n"

#~ "The XVI census program has just gone into effect. Weekly rolling tests have commenced this morning, and I've got a full report on our estimated performance levels and operational details.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests are performed by existing nursing staff under the supervision of a small police or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will perform the arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for containment and study. Once the aliens figure out this scheme -- I don't think it'll take them long -- the infected people will start avoiding the census, thereby giving us the data we need simply by their absence.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. 99.9% of the planet's population is registered with one national authority or another, but out of ten billion people that still leaves several million unaccounted for. We will be able to extrapolate figures that are accurate to within several thousand heads, but the statistics we generate won't ever be exact. This means the program is less useful for identifying those who have been infected, but still a godsend for keeping track of XVI spread and alien activity on a global basis. After all, we need to know what kind of progress we're making against this new threat.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to shoulder the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the equipment and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the reliability of personnel and the validity of the results.

This will work in conjunction with our normal detection methods to warn us where alien activity is worst and allow us to intervene before the situation becomes critical.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Any area where XVI seems to be gaining ground should be posted with additional air patrols, and we should be on the lookout for any attempts by the aliens to solidify their hold on the ground. Alien activity reports in this area should be investigated and responded to with extreme prejudice.\n"

#~ "With these new developments regarding the infection of Earth's civilian population by this alien organism, the need arises for a way to determine the number of infected people in various regions and the rate of spread. Easier said than done, I know, but it may be every bit as important as finding a cure. We can't help anyone if we don't know they're sick.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "What I propose to do is to create a long-term rolling census that checks all registered individuals on the entire planet for XVI infection by way of a small blood test. Everyone will be required to submit to this test once a week to make sure they're clean -- more frequently if they fall under suspicion of infection. Samples will only need to be as large as a single drop of blood, taken from a random vein to prevent tampering. Fortunately the XVI organism is large and prevalent enough that we can test these samples on the spot with near-100%-confidence results.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "This is going to be a major undertaking that requires careful liaising with the intelligence services of Earth's eight big nations. I've already prepared plans and simulations to demonstrate the operation and effectiveness of this program. With some time and funding, we can convince them of the project's importance and have everything operational in a matter of weeks.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "Technical Document, Sigma Clearance -- Commander's Eyes Only\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Filed: 19 March 2084\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military airplane still flying today.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, and more. The Saracen can carry about twice the electronics load of a Stiletto-class Interceptor, with room to spare for further modular equipment.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts badly into weapons capacity. The Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that implies. Though it can take much more damage than a Stiletto and remain effective, the Saracen will not perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Saracen requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 2 weapon hardpoints; 2 medium belly bays.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"

#~ "Overview\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "It is clear that the Stiletto-class Interceptor, while a terrific aircraft, does not cover all our needs. We must be ready to defend our planet and our people anywhere across the globe. The Stiletto's operational range is too limited and it is not fast enough to engage all the UFOs we might detect.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Only one aircraft in the world is capable of filling the operational gap we face; the Argentinian KB-550 Hypersonic Wing, dubbed the \"Saracen\" in NATO code. Mixing old and new stealth technology into a single airframe, the Saracen most resembles the ancient SR-71 \"Blackbird\" in its shape and bearing. It is black as the night itself, covered in radiation-absorbing paint that makes it practically invisible to radar, lidar and most other forms of active scanning. Its fuselage is composed almost entirely of carbon nanotubes and sheets of graphite-reinforced plastic. This makes the craft extremely strong and heat-resistant enough to cope with the temperatures of cruising at speeds in excess of Mach 4. The Saracen is the fastest military airplane still flying today.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "In terms of its capabilities, the Saracen pushes our interception range into international territory. Its huge, armoured tanks and amazing fuel-efficiency allow it to go anywhere up to 10,000 kilometres from its hangar at hypersonic speeds -- and back again -- with fuel to spare for combat manoeuvres. Its stealthy design, high speed and tough airframe allow it to engage UFOs that our Stiletto-class Interceptors may simply be unable to catch. It has tough armour and can fly home even on one engine. Thanks to the power of its engines and a set of additional manoeuvring thrusters in its belly, it can take off almost vertically; this is definitely within the restrictions of our hangar facilities.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Its electronics suite is similarly impressive. It has state-of-the-art targeting computers, advanced radar and lidar systems, advanced ECM (Electronic Counter-Measures) equipment, in-helmet VR imaging for the pilot, and more. The Saracen can carry about twice the electronics load of a Stiletto-class Interceptor, with room to spare for further modular equipment.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Unfortunately, for all its strengths, it is costly to lease and maintain, and its heavy load of fuel and armour cuts badly into weapons capacity. The Saracen cannot equal the weapons load of the far smaller and less expensive Stiletto. Nor can it hope to equal the Stiletto's manoeuvrability. Despite thrust-vectoring technology (the ability to change the shape of its engine nozzles to direct thrust), electro-elastic wing surface (the ability to dynamically change the shape of its wings) and other terrific advances, the Saracen is still a large fixed-wing aircraft with all the limitations that implies. Though it can take much more damage than a Stiletto and remain effective, the Saracen will not perform as well in combat with alien craft.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Saracen requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 2 weapon hardpoints; 2 medium belly bays.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "At its heart the Saracen is a long-range interceptor to be used against extremely distant or fast UFOs. Unlike the alien craft, it is barely slowed by moving inside Earth atmosphere, making it slightly faster than most of the UFOs we have observed so far. This will allow PHALANX to catch the aliens wherever they may be going -- short of interplanetary space.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "As always, the Saracen's performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured without solid observational data from at least one real combat encounter. However, if deployed in large enough flights, it should be able to cut up alien craft of all varieties.\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "Commander, I've been over these old files before you, and I have decided to replace them with my own assessment and conclusions about our choice of dropship. Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even got out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two surviving examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in government warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig out of storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I can't even find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us. I'm doing my best to find superior alternatives for gear that just isn't up to the task.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The one bit of good luck in this dropship mess is that I managed to persuade our UN rep to earmark some budget for a new ship, and I think you'll like it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered aviation fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.74. At a maximum velocity of Mach 1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes a lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of emergencies. It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose, which will mount anti-air weapons such as aircraft cannons or missile racks. It can also carry additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers and a cargo bay which can contain and deploy small battlefield vehicles.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as the Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than any fixed-wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to threats all over the world.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 1 medium weapon hardpoint located in the nose.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Recommended Doctrine\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity and to recover downed alien craft.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Once a site has been cleared of live aliens, heavily-wounded soldiers will immediately be dispatched for medical treatment. The remaining troops will secure the area until a PHALANX recovery team can take over and ensure delivery of any and all alien artifacts to our facilities. This is important because attempted looting of items left on the battlefield may become a problem in densely-populated regions. We can't afford to lose valuable alien technology because some idiot feels the need to take a souvenir.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "While armed, a Firebird-class dropship is not able to stand up to dedicated fighters, and it should never be sent as the sole interceptor to any UFO sighting.\n"
