"Komentaja, olen erittäin iloinen voidessani kertoa, että projektimme on onnistunut.Liitän mukaan kuvat kannettavan laser aseen prototyypistä, joka saavuttaa jatkuvan aallon laser tehon.\n"
"\n"
"Käytännöllisin ratkaisu ei ollut siinä, että yritettiin luoda suurempia akkuja, vaan käytännöllisin idea oli miniatyyrisointi, teknologian kevennys ja supistaminen käyttäen nykyisiä kemian käyttämiä laser komponentteja.\n"
"\n"
"Kemialliset laserit ovat olleet käytössä jo kauan. Osa jopa 20-luvulta. 20-luvun kokeiluissa oli paljon ongelmia.Nyt kuitenkin, osastomme on rakentanut perinteisen Laser tykin pienoiskoossa. Pienestä koostaan huolimatta se on täysin kykenevä käsittelemään deuterium-fluoridi reaktiota. Reaktio sisältää myrkyllisiä jätteitä ilman saastumisvaaraa.\n"
"\n"
"Annan teille lyhyen kuvauksen aseen toiminnasta. Sisäpuolelle palotilaan, etyleeniä poltetaan typpitrifluoridilla. Tämä reaktio tuottaa fluorin radikaaleja, jotka sitten saavuttavat kosketuksen heliumin ja deuterium kanssa. Deuterium reagoi fluorin kanssa ja tuottavat innoissaan molekyylejä, Deuteriumfluoridi. Näiden tehtävä on emissio ja aseen optinen resonaattori, joka tuottaa palkin. Useiden älykkäiden linssien jälkeen palkki ohjataan ampujan tähtäyspisteeseen, ase jopa korjaa pieniä ampujan tärinöitä.Deuterium jätekaasuja varten on tilaustyönä suunniteltu korkeapaineinen suodatusjärjestelmä, johon kaikki myrkylliset tai radioaktiivisten molekyylit suodattuvat, ennen kuin jäljellä oleva vaaraton höyryn päästetään takaisin ilmakehään.\n"
"\n"
"Suodatin on vaihdettava jokaisen tehtävän jälkeen, mutta olemme suunnitelleet järjestelmän, jotta tätä olisi helppoa ja vaivatonta. Jos suodatin järjestelmä on jotenkin vaurioitunut operaation aikana ase välittömästi lopettaa toimintansa, tällöin vältetään saastuminen. Laser toimii keski-infrapuna-aallonpituuksilla, joten sitä ei näy kuin IR-suojalasit yllään.\n"
"\n"
"Prototyyppi on rakennettu, mutta se ei ole vielä valmis täysimittaiseen tuotantoon jalkaväen aseena, koska jalostus ja tasapainottaminen edellyttää testausta. Uudistuksien jälkeen asetta voidaan soveltaa myös ajoneuvojen aseina - jopa ilmatorjuntana. Olen lähettänyt useita uusia ehdotuksia sähköpostiisi. Ilmoittakaa minulle, kun haluat aloittaa niiden käsittelyn, komentaja.\n"

Olemme erityisen kiinnostuneita Jatkuvan Aalto Laser-aseen tiedostoista.\n"
"\n"
"Monet maat ja yritykset ovat pyrkineet luomaan aseisiin laserit vuosien ajan, mutta kukaan ei ole kyennyt luomaan laseria, joka olisi ihmisen kannettava ja sen teho olisi riittävän suuri kilpailemaan tavallisten aseiden kanssa. Nyt kuitenkin olemme saaneet tutustua tähän tutkimukseen. Uskon, että me voimme tehdä tarpeeksi tehokkaan kannettavan laser-aseen, voimme tehdä sen koosta tarpeeksi pienen.\n"

Unless and until we can get our hands on this equipment, our efforts will be fruitless.\n"

For myself, I think we should try to head the aliens off at the pass in this regard.

Arpia on löytynyt muukalaisen kurkunpäästä. Voimme näin päätellä, että laitteita on kirurgisesti istutettu kurkkuun hyvin varhaisessa iässä.Jossain vaiheessa murrosiässä, lapsille tarkoitettu laite poistetaan ja aikuisten versio istutetaan.\n"
"\n"
"Olemme tutkineet useita eri vaihtoehtoja laitteen toiminnasta ravinnon jalostamiseen ja itsemurhalaitteeseen, mutta selvä vastaus osoittautui olevan oikea.Se on jonkinlainen hengityssuojain, jolloin muukalaiset voivat selviytyä meidän ilmakehässä ja mahdollisesti myös muissa ilmakehissä. Jokainen orgaanisessa mallissa on tällainen laite, jossa on kaikki samat toiminnot, mikä tarkoittaa ette ne toimivat funktionaalisesti ja he voivat selviytyä missä tahansa ilmakehässä.Tai sitten me näemme vain yksilöitä, jotka ovat tarkoitettu vain planeettojen toimintaa varten.Varmasti ulkoinen hengityssuojain olisi helpompi ja edullisempi käyttää, jos näillä yksilöillä olisi tarkoitus tehdä vain lyhyitä retkiä vihamielisiin atmosfääreihin.\n"
"\n"
"Laite koostuu hienostuneesta suodattimesta, joka on laitettu kohteen henkitorveen, ja kahdesta pienestä pallomaisesta säilöstä, jotka ovat sijoitettu molemmin puolin aivokudosta, joka yhdistyy henkitorveen pienen metalliputken avulla. Nämä säiliöt ovat täytetty kaasuseoksella, joka puristetaan nestemäisessä olomuodossa, niiden toiminta näyttää perustuvan samanlaiseen ideaan kuin scuba diverin happipullot. Suodatin mekanismi on älykäs, se tunnollisesti poistaa kaikki haitalliset aineet, mutta antaa hyödyllistä osia vain läpi. Säiliöt voidaan täyttää tekemällä pieni mekaaninen napa muukalaisen kaulaan takana.\n"
"\n"
"Tarkastelu säiliöiden sisällöstä on antanut meille tarkkaa tietoa ulkomaalaisen ilmakehästä.Meillä on nyt useita seoksia varastoitu, uskomme että voimme tukea erilaisten muukalaisten säilyttämistä muukalaissäilytystilassa. Muutamia seoksia ovat typpi-happi-yhdisteet, hyvin samankaltainen kuin omamme, mutta toiset eivät sisällä happea lainkaan. Jos näitä kaikkia seoksia käyttävät yksi tai useampi muukalaislajeista, jotkut näistä vihollisista näyttävät hengittävän ilmakehässä melkein lähes puhdasta metaania.\n"
"\n"
"Hyvin erilaisia seoksia on paljon ja se antaa meille pienoisen palapelin. Eikö olisi edullisempaa käyttää erillistä miehistöä kuin pakottaa näiden lajien rinnakkaiselo samassa paikassa?\n"

"Tulevaisuuden kysymyksiä, olemme hyvin tyytyväisiä tämän tuloksiin.\n"

"I'm happy to report that we've received the first good results in our ongoing efforts to question captive aliens in our Containment unit. Dr. Yamamura's approach has gradually begun to bear fruit. The aliens have learned to convey messages in both binary code and human-readable sign language, and they appear to comprehend a wide range of questions and instructions. Yamamura and his staff are still working to refine the sign language we've been using, while the rest of my team has concentrated on trying to extract useful information from the hive mind. This hasn't been easy. The aliens are very reticent and require a great deal of chemical encouragement in order to put them into a more helpful frame of mind. The casualty rate has been high.\n"
"\n"
"However, what we have is significant. For instance, the hive mind seems to have no identity. It seems unable to grasp concepts like \"I\" or \"We\", or even \"You\" and \"Them\". It only accepts these words as numerical differentiations -- one specimen or several, one human or a group. This indicates a severe disconnect between human and alien thinking. The shared consciousness doesn't even think of itself as a single enclosed entity; it merely is. This, along with various other answers we've pieced together from our continued sessions, leads us to believe that all aliens do indeed share one single mind. And I mean all of them, Commander. It's not simply a means of increasing team efficiency or encouraging esprit de corps; it's an indispensible component of alien society. Every alien that lives and breathes is an equal and identical part of the greater hive mind, even specimens of completely different species. The only diversity the aliens will acknowledge is in the different substances required to keep the various species alive.\n"
"\n"
"Also, the hive mind has expressed puzzlement at our attempts to communicate with individual aliens, let alone through something as crude as sign language. A human-understandable analogy might be trying to have a deep conversation with someone's toenail, or talking to a single cell in your own body. Of course, that raises the question of where the alien ears and brain really are.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly the handful of aliens currently in our Containment unit are not part of the greater hive mind that we hypothesize exists on the alien homeworld. They seem to be cut off from it for the duration of their mission to Earth, only to rejoin it when they return later. Whether this is due to distance or some kind of atmospheric effect, we've not yet been able to tell. The aliens' answers are hazy on this subject.\n"
"\n"
"That is all I have to report, Commander. However, as a final note, I would like to request your permission to look into methods we could use to more effectively persuade our captives. I must also stress that we require a healthy influx of new alien specimens in order to replace losses. We have to maintain the isolated hive mind we have in Containment. Losing it now would be a significant setback to our research.\n"

"The increasing intellect of the captive aliens in our Containment unit leads me to conclude that we can finally begin to get a real handle on alien communication and, more importantly, getting some useable information out of them. Quoting from my report:\n"
"\n"
"(Odd Behaviour)\"There are several species of alien, all of which meet the physiological requirements for a sentient species, but they show little to no brainwave activity of their own. This implies the presence of some kind of shared or distributed thought between them, a hive mind that grows more intelligent as it grows in numbers.\"\n"
"\n"
"\"With several specimens on hand, their intelligence now seems to be approaching the human level. If we can create a suitable translation device or common language, we believe we may finally be able to establish communications with aliens in PHALANX captivity. Perhaps some of our linguists or psychology experts could form a dialogue. This is an avenue of inquiry that we cannot afford to ignore.\"\n"
"\n"
"Dr. Yamamura is beginning to make real progress on this front, teaching the aliens several new words of sign language every day, but we require lab time and funding for a proper study of what these aliens know and how it can help us. The ability to interrogate aliens about their own technology could be of incomparable value to our soldiers and engineers. Cdr. Navarre was so excited at the prospect, he almost argued in favour of DivBio on this one.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"As you're aware, we are facing an increasingly worsening threat from the XVI virus. Over the past few weeks, DivIntel has been making a push into the areas in which the infection is most concentrated, in order to try and find some piece of intel that could help us understand how and why this infection spreads so fast from these focal points. I have been personally supervising the effort.\n"
"\n"
"It paid off this morning.\n"
"\n"
"Our reconnaisance teams have located what appears to be a camouflaged alien installation. The size and purpose of this installation is unknown, but we've established that it is located at the exact heart of an infection hot-spot. I harbour grave suspicions that this facility is directly connected with the lightning spread of XVI in the region. At this point it also seems likely there are more of these planetside installations, built right under our noses, serving as command centres and bases of operation for the alien threat.\n"
"\n"
"Dealing with these bases has to be one of our top priorities. I recommend we send a heavily-armed team to pay them a visit, a bit of reconnaissance-in-force. We need more information about the layout and purpose of the base, and the best way to do that is to capture it. We should eliminate all aliens at the location and, once we've secured the area and salvaged what we need, destroy the entire installation. This should constitute a significant blow to alien operations and restrict -- if not halt -- the spread of XVI in the area.\n"
"\n"
"Of course this mission will be highly dangerous. The base is right in the middle of an infection hot-spot, so the entire area is hostile territory. We may encounter anti-air ordnance and UFOs scrambled to the base's defence. A heavy escort will certainly be required. And . . . there's worse.\n"
"\n"
"Satellite imagery and recon flyovers have indicated that infected humans appear to be actively cooperating with the aliens. There's a good probability our unit will encounter human hostiles during the assault. This may not sit well with everyone, but if they open fire on our troops, we must be ready to respond in kind.\n"
"\n"
"That's all the intel I've got for you on this one, Sir. Good luck and good hunting.\n"

"\n"
"The work we've done on alien biology since the start of the invasion, along with some help from our captives, has put us on the track of certain psychotropic substances -- notably LSD-derivatives -- that have very interesting effects on alien psychology. The divergence of species has been a problem, as some compounds will work on one type of alien but not on another, but with this new data it will be an easy task to whip up drugs specifically tailored to the individual alien species.\n"
"\n"
"Subjects under the influence of this drug have proven to be more pliable and loose-lipped, as long as we keep injecting all the specimens in our containment unit. Unfortunately the hive mind's natural resistance to interrogation is still throwing a spanner in the works. Even with all our specimens fully injected, we've not managed to break that resistance, and the accuracy of our test information has still not been 100% reliable. All data we receive still requires some degree of time-consuming verification work.\n"
"\n"
"On the positive side, the act of getting the information out of our subjects has become quicker and more painless, which should speed up some of our research. The danger of allergenic reaction is much lower and the number of subjects succumbing during interrogation has dropped significantly. The deeper effect of the new drugs may even give us access to more sensitive information that we would not have been able to extract from the hive mind with our old serum.\n"

"As you may know, our efforts at communication with the live aliens in our Containment unit are progressing only very slowly. We're having a great deal of trouble applying our standard interrogation methods. The truth serum we have available has several distinct limitations; it tends to produce a lethal allergic reaction in most alien bodies unless we restrict it to smaller, insufficient doses, which worsens the serum's already incomplete effect on alien physiology. We've encountered numerous small lies and half-truths in the sessions we've taken so far. Torture has been attempted to influence this behaviour, but to no avail. Pain seems to have no corrective effect on the hive mind.\n"
"\n"
"There's also the larger hurdle of having to inject every single specimen of the hive mind in order to properly submerge any subject's sense of judgment. If one member of the hive mind dies, the remaining specimens' adrenaline-equivalent levels rise to the point where we have to start over.\n"
"\n"
"To this end, armed with our expanded knowledge of the alien mind and body, I propose a new research program to look into a universal set of sera that we can use to extract more reliable information, faster and more easily. There is obviously a great deal of information inside these specimens waiting to be seized, Commander; we just need the tools to properly crack the shell.\n"

"Good morning, Sir.\n"
"\n"
"I've got the results of our Alien Origins project here and I believe you'll find them encouraging. Here is my summary of the data.\n"
"\n"
"The project overall has been a resounding success in integration and cooperation. For several short periods over the past few days, we had direct control over every civilian and military detection asset in the solar system, including several installations in the asteroid belt so secret that we have been sworn to silence by the UN. Our deep-space probes have scanned every inch of buildable surface to detect any sign of an alien base. With these resources at our disposal, we have achieved continuous detection coverage of approximately 90% of the solar system over the past two weeks. The remaining 10% has been uncovered no longer than forty minutes at a time.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately -- depending on your understanding of the word 'unfortunately' -- we could find no evidence of alien fleets hiding in our solar system. We have been so thorough that these results are all but conclusive. There is no way to be absolutely sure that our conclusions are correct, but I make the following statement with high confidence:\n"
"\n"
"We do not believe there are alien ships or bases in our solar system at this time.\n"
"\n"
"This answers one of our questions, but brings us no closer to understanding where the aliens come from or how they get here. In fact, the question of how they get here becomes an even greater conundrum than it was before. If the aliens are not based in our solar system, how can they be delivering UFOs to Earth?\n"
"\n"
"I have spoken at length with Cdr. Navarre and members of his team about this issue, trying to figure it out, and most of our theories still seem like crackpot speculations even to ourselves. However, fate gave us the proof we needed.\n"
"\n"
"We were having little luck with the issues of 'how' and 'where' until we got our hands on last week's video records from the MIMIR space telescope. Upon watching the footage, we realised that the MIMIR array had accidentally managed to catch a UFO arrival on film. We have full records in the visible and infrared spectra of a large, unfamiliar class of UFO 'popping' into existence approximately 10,000 kilometres from Earth, from where it ignited its engines and set a course for the planet.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible the aliens could have some manner of 'cloaking' technology that has prevented us from detecting the UFO beyond that range, but we have strong doubts about this; the appearance was highly sudden, accompanied by a burst of gamma rays and a momentary gravitic anomaly. There was not even the slightest evidence of this UFO's existence prior to its appearance 10,000 klicks from Earth.\n"
"\n"
"The most likely conclusion is also the most frightening: the aliens do not need to be located in our solar system, because they have a means of travel that is faster than light. Apparently this FTL (Faster-Than-Light) drive allows them to 'jump' into the Sol system from a distance well beyond our detection range. We don't know how this could be possible, as it clearly violates one or more concepts of general relativity (e.g. causality and/or special relativity), which remains the most accurate model of physics we have. The aliens clearly know something we don't.\n"
"\n"
"Our next priority must be the capture of an FTL-equipped UFO so that we may study and adapt this drive for our own spacecraft. Obviously, this will not be an easy task, but developing the ability to strike back is paramount -- just in case we need to end this invasion the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, the final decision on how to balance our short-term defence needs and long-term retaliation rests with you, Commander.\n"

"Though we are still struggling to get operational, one of our first orders of business must be to find out where the aliens are coming from. The only thing we know right now is that they enter the atmosphere from space, do what they came to do, and then race into orbit again before disappearing from our screens. We need to find out what happens before and after these points. Where do they come from, how do they get here, and where do they go?\n"
"\n"
"We've seen no evidence of ships holding in Earth orbit or basing facilities anywhere in the solar system, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. The region of the asteroid belt and the outer planets -- the space between Mars and Neptune -- has been poorly monitored in a military sense and, given the stealth capabilities demonstrated by attacking UFOs, an alien fleet may have been misidentified or simply failed to register on civilian equipment. There has been no comprehensive effort at all to scan the surface of the various base-viable celestial objects in our solar system.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, I propose a new research program aimed at scouring the solar system with probes and powerful optical- and radiotelescopes to detect alien activity anywhere in our space. Our scientists will also review the data we have of past incursions to try and form some kind of picture of alien movements to and from Earth orbit. Even if there's a fleet hiding behind Mars or one of the outer planets, they must eventually reveal themselves if they continue sending UFOs down to the surface of Earth. If we put enough eyes on the problem, even these aliens can't hide for long.\n"

"This project will take a significant amount of funding and lab-time, Commander, so it requires your authorisation before work can begin.\n"

"Commander, my team and I have finished our analysis of the UFO we captured. It's a real miracle of engineering, and we're all looking forward to getting a chance to sink our own hooks into all this lovely technology.\n"
"\n"
"The craft's strange construction has raised a lot of questions for us to answer. Much of the design seems to make little sense when viewed from the ground. However, now that we've managed to look at it up close and personal -- and test the alien hull materials under laboratory conditions -- we have gained a far clearer picture of UFO capabilities. I've made a list of our most important discoveries.\n"
"\n"
"-- The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to keep it cool and to reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electrical needs.\n"
"\n"
"-- The fuel tank is very, very small, measured in fractions of a gramme, but even so I nearly had a heart attack when we found out what was in there. If a containment loss occurred on one of these tanks, even three tenths of a gramme of this antimatter would outstrip the explosive force of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Naturally the tank is armoured and buried as deep as possible within the fuselage, and there are mechanical systems present to jettison the tank in an emergency, but they aren't perfect. A direct hit on the tank or the containment system could still cause an explosion. Much of the blast would be contained by the UFO's tough structure, but any explosion represents an extreme hazard to our interceptors. The only saving grace is that proton-antiproton explosions create little radioactive fallout.\n"
"\n"
"-- The craft is extremely difficult to see with human detection equipment, regardless of any electronic warfare capability on the aliens' part. This is largely due to the hull materials which very effectively absorb all kinds of radiation. We've had the most luck with passive infrared and gamma radiation detection, as the antimatter-based engines produce quite a lot of both.\n"
"\n"
"-- The slim design, generating poor lift and being difficult to handle in air, is partly due to the heavy weight of the hull materials. It would be impossible to create effective wings from the alien hull materials. Instead, every gramme of excess matter has been stripped off, and the craft moves at high speeds so as to need very little lift surface. The material itself is quite astonishing, part metal and part plastic polymer. It functions as a memory alloy, 'remembering' at least two assigned shapes, shrinking into a more compact form when cold but automatically stretching out and assuming a more comfortable flying shape once it heats up. It's stronger and tougher than any known material on Earth (barring pure carbon nanotubes) and far more versatile in aircraft design. More research is definitely required.\n"
"\n"
"Armed with these facts, we can now begin to analyse the different components and roles of the UFO. I recommend that our engineers begin dismantling this craft for parts right away. Who knows what we'll discover with the individual bits and pieces in front of us?\n"
"\n"
"More research on the UFO itself is also warranted. I think we can delve deeper into its intended function and perhaps gain some insight in how to counter its activities. I'll send you another proposal about it as soon as I can.\n"
"\n"
"Whatever we end up learning from these craft, Commander, it can only help us in the fight for Earth.\n"

Are any of its systems still active or boobytrapped? What kind of materials is it made of? What dangers might it pose during storage or disassembly? All these questions and more need to be answered before we do anything further.\n"

The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used in fully-automatic weapons, since no firearms action on this Earth can survive that much violence for long without breaking. The British APMP pistol ignores these concerns by using more ordinary smokeless powder and a longer, almost SMG-length barrel to achieve higher velocities and greater kinetic power. It is a true machine pistol, fully automatic and capable of firing 600 rounds per minute from its surprisingly slim-lined 30-round detachable box magazine. It has three firing modes: semi-automatic, 3-round burst, and full-automatic.\n"
"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through kevlar like it wasn't there. Once inside a human body this tiny round tumbles like a madman and creates huge wound cavities. It has a deal of trouble penetrating modern body armour, but this is offset by the APMP's ability to deliver repeated hits from its large magazine, all in a pistol-sized package. Unfortunately, the APMP can be a little unwieldy due to its size. Accuracy during burst and fully-automatic fire suffers as a result.\n"

It is a good alternative for soldiers who have trouble hitting anything with the P-12, but the MP-699 is low-powered in comparison with the P-12. Furthermore, its magazines are large enough to preclude hanging them from a soldier's belt and far fewer of them can be carried conveniently.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may consider using two pistols at the same time, though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single MP-699 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties.

"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"The French LeBlanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) provides the most advantageous mix of range, penetration against alien armour, and magazine size in the assault rifle class. It is a bullpup design, meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce overall weapon length. The 191 fires a 30-round box magazine of 4.7mm caseless ammunition, tungsten-cored steel penetrators with impressive armour-piercing capability over short and medium ranges. The round does not perform well at long range, but then assault rifles aren't meant for long-range firefights.\n"
"\n"
"Though the design is far from new, first prototyped in 2057, no other rifle has fully surpassed the 191. It is accurate and quick to reload. Its rugged construction makes it dependable in combat and unlikely to break or jam. It is resistant to heat, cold, dust and humidity all at once. Ammunition and replacement parts are widely available due to the design's maturity and relative popularity among Earth's armed forces. This is a rifle you can entrust your life to.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"This should be our go-to weapon for medium-range engagements. It can lay down an impressive amount of fire and is deadly out to far longer ranges than any pistol or SMG.\n"
"\n"
"However, no one should entertain the illusion that the assault rifle is the end-all be-all of our arsenal. A balance of weapons is required for us to be able to deal with different situations; while the assault rifle remains a good weapon at close range, it can be slow to manoeuvre in tight spaces and is eclipsed by both submachine guns and shotguns at these ranges, weapons which provide a far greater point-blank punch. Any sweep of an urban building should be led by close-range weapons, while rifle-equipped soldiers either secure the perimeter or form a second assault wave to support the others.\n"
"\n"
"If our rifle-equipped troops are caught beyond effective weapon range, they should make an advance from cover to cover in order to effectively bring their weapons to bear. Snipers should provide covering fire for the advancing teams or attempt to take out the enemy at range.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"While the AR-80 is a fine rifle in all respects, it was not designed to fight an alien invasion force. We should develop our own purpose-built weapons as soon as it becomes feasible to do so."

"The British SA-3000 GPG (General-Purpose Gun), colloquially known as the Great British Gun, is a versatile drum-fed machine gun that has seen service throughout the world in its 16-year operational life. First deployed in 2068, it quickly found its niche as a light machine gun for infantry and ground-support helicopters, able to be fired from the hip as easily as from a bipod or pintle mount.\n"
"\n"
"The infantry version of the GPG is a highly versatile and reliable gun. Unlike most machine guns the GPG takes caseless ammunition from a large drum magazine instead of a belt. This limits fire rate and magazine endurance, but it's also the reason for the weapon's versatility. The reloading process for the GPG is almost as quick and easy as an assault rifle, and the drums contain 100 rounds each. This allows the GPG to be used almost as a heavy assault rifle. The magazines are on the bulky side, but still small and light enough for an average soldier to carry several of them into battle.\n"
"\n"
"The gun contains surprisingly few computerised components, only a powerful recoil compensator and shock absorbing system. This helps to improve accuracy above that of older machine guns, although it's never going to be a sniper rifle. The solid design and sheer simplicity of its internals combine to make the GPG a very reliable weapon. It has seen action in Mumbai and performed admirably there, providing effective and highly mobile suppressive fire, sometimes capable of pinning down whole alien squads depending on the terrain.\n"
"\n"
"The GPG fires the popular 4.7mm caseless round, also used in our AR-80 Assault Rifle. Unfortunately the magazines are not interchangeable between Assault Rifle and GPG, as the Assault Rifle uses a different feed system.\n"
"\n"
"We feel that the GPG is the best candidate for our arsenal in the machine gun category. Our troops can depend on this gun to deliver heaps of fire when and where they need it most.\n"

"The South-African MPMDS (Multi-Purpose Missile Delivery System) has a classic, almost surgically clean name that completely belies its purpose. It is the heaviest infantry missile launcher on the market, able to fire anti-tank shells as easily as high-explosive rockets that turn infantry into hamburger. Originally intended as light field artillery, this weapon is fairly new; its only combat experience has been in Mumbai in the hands of Commonwealth troops. It was one of the handful of weapons that eventually turned the tide in the fighting -- and there is a good reason why.\n"
"\n"
"Alien craft on the ground emit fantastic amounts of jamming and other EW (Electronic Warfare) activity. In fact, they emit so much of it that ordinary 'smart' missiles are rendered completely ineffective. If one type of alien EW doesn't fool the missile's relatively stupid electronic brain, another will. No amount of tinkering by Earth's military engineers has been able to fix the situation. The MPMDS, however, will remain effective against the alien invaders -- one of the few human missile launchers that can -- because its rockets carry no onboard guidance.\n"
"\n"
"The rockets are 120mm monsters the size of artillery shells. They are fired out of a smoothbore barrel, fin-stabilised in flight, and have a maximum effective range of 70 metres. Surprisingly they are made up of only three parts: a rocket booster, a warhead and an impact trigger. This simplicity allows them to remain effective and reliable in the most hazardous situations. Though the rockets are not very accurate, they will devastate anything in their path, even aliens. It takes only one good hit from an MPMDS rocket to send the enemy flying.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for this launcher includes: HE (High-Explosive) rockets, AA (Anti-Armour) rockets, and IC (Incendiary) rockets. New types of MPMDS ammo were being researched by Commonwealth manufacturers before the start of the war. We have all their data on file and could use it to create revolutionary new rocket types.\n"

"\n"
"Friendly troops should be kept away from the rear of the launcher during firing; the hot exhaust gases are extremely dangerous to nearby humans. The HPML should not be fired at targets closer than 8 metres from the shooter. Violating these safety guidelines could result in serious injury or death to the shooter and other members of the team. If a target is closer than 8 metres, any shooter should immediately resort to his sidearm or a combat knife. Anything else would be suicide.\n"

"The EM rifle project has been a resounding success! For the first time in human history, we've created a viable man-portable electromagnetic weapon. We have named our weapon the Bolter Rifle to avoid ambiguity with other existing MAG (Magnetic Accelerator Gun) implementations. I'll do my best to explain its operation in this short summary.\n"
"\n"
"The Bolter Rifle is equipped with a railgun configuration, as opposed to a coilgun/Gauss gun configuration, due to the high inefficiency and generally poor operation of coilguns. Railguns work by utilising electromagnetic force to propel an electrically conductive projectile along two conducting rails. The electric current flowing through the rails sets up a magnetic field between them and through the projectile. The direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current flowing through the rails and the projectile; this results in the rails and projectile pushing each other, thereby accelerating the projectile along the rails.\n"
"\n"
"The world's first large-scale railgun, built in the 1970s, used 500 MJ of stored energy from the largest homopolar generator ever built. The electrical equipment needed to power these guns has become much more compact in the past century or so, but it is still not small or light enough to create man-portable weapons capable of replacing chemical-propellant firearms. Another major failing of railguns is their extreme susceptibility to rail erosion. The rails suffer heavy damage from every shot fired along them, and when the contact points are badly damaged, the electric current cannot properly pass from the rails through the projectile. This causes successive shots to lose more and more of their power. Each round needs at least a short length of undamaged rail in order to build up velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, we've managed to find a way around this problem -- by loading new rails into the gun after every series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of pre-loading all of a weapon's ammunition into the barrel has been around for a long time. Until now it has only been applied to conventional firearms, but we have come up with a new concept; a small, individually-powered and insulated length of rail loaded with every round. This gives each round a viable contact point and will allow the weapon to sustain power through all its shots. When all rounds in the current barrel have been depleted -- and therefore the rails thoroughly destroyed -- the soldier can simply unlock the old barrel, let it drop to the ground, and slot in a fresh spare. Then he can replace the battery pack for a new series of shots.\n"
"\n"
"The projectiles are specially-developed 3.2x40mm finned flechettes, stamped from large sheets of tungsten alloy. They are razor-sharp, with excellent armour-piercing qualities, and they tumble like demons inside the target. The holes that these flechettes cause are many times larger than their actual size.\n"
"\n"
"This choice of loading system makes the Bolter slow and clumsy to reload, with expensive, oversized magazines (a new barrel and battery pack for each reload) and a small ammo capacity of 4 shots per barrel. On the other hand, the Bolter's stopping power is far greater than any chemical firearm in our arsenal. It can be used both as a sniper rifle and a powerful assault weapon, depending on whether it is fired on semi-automatic or 4-round burst mode. It is a highly versatile weapon with many possible applications; its tactical value will certainly become apparent once we get some real combat experience with it.\n"

"Commander, we've received a number of research files from several UN nations concerning research and development for man-portable electromagnetic weaponry; various designs have been proposed and even prototyped for railguns, coilguns and quench guns. Of course, all these experiments have failed, since electromagnetic weapons require huge amounts of power -- and therefore banks of capacitors so heavy that no human soldier could possibly carry them. Even atomic batteries have not given us the power output we need to make man-portable electromagnetic guns a reality. It is impossible.\n"
"\n"
"At least, that's what we thought, until the aliens showed up.\n"
"\n"
"Seeing alien craft hurtling through our skies, advanced robots scuttling through our streets, and high-powered energy weapons tearing up our people has given us a whole host of new ideas. It has also caused us to take a very close look through our collected UN research data. It's nothing short of a gold mine in disguise. By combining the best of these individual cluttered pieces, we believe we may be able to devise a new weapon for our tactical teams that will be both man-portable and combat-effective.

It also has a bayonet ring for affixing the knife to the barrel of an old-style battle rifle.\n"

Only in a handful of occasions have experienced knife-fighters been able to win out against alien opponents.\n"

All of these models snapped in half during the cooling process. We had a devil of a time figuring out why until we placed a small camera inside the furnace.\n"
"\n"
"It turns out that the curve of the Kerrblade isn't a design choice -- it's a function of the material itself. The plastic radically curves and expands during heat-moulding in our furnace, and contracts again during cooling, which ended up cracking all of our straight-edged blades. It demands a particular curved shape to retain its durability as a blade. We had to completely redesign the knife to account for this effect, which brought it to its current shape.\n"
"\n"
"In length, it's either a long knife or a short sword, depending on who you ask. The design of the handle and crossguard are based on Middle-Eastern and Asian swordmaking traditions mixed in with modern-day science and know-how. The handle is made from semi-solid rubber, which automatically moulds itself to the wielder's hand to maximise comfort and gripping power. Both the triangular crossguard and pommel are unbreakable carbon-nanotube-reinforced plastic, a material that even Kerrblades have trouble with.\n"
"\n"
"This knife goes a long way towards evening the odds for our soldiers when they get caught in hand-to-hand. Though it's larger than our old combat knife, doesn't thrust as well, and doesn't have the power of the Kerrblade's sword-length swing, it strikes an ideal middle ground between these two weapons. The monomolecular knife is almost the equal of the Kerrblade in lethality but still small enough to be worn in our standard holster or in a sheath hung from the belt. It amounts to a significant upgrade of our melee combat capabilities, and I'm thoroughly pleased with the result.\n"

"Commander, now that we've had a good look at the alien blade technology from several sources -- the Bloodspider's 'fangs' and the Kerrblade -- we're starting to form a picture of how to recreate the unknown or ill-understood materials used in their construction.\n"
"\n"
"Some of this stuff is completely new to us. The plastics from which the alien blades are forged are harder than damascus steel, sharper than a razor, and yet shock-resistant and flexible enough to survive the stresses of melee combat. Once forged they are nearly impossible to break, nick or bend. Applying a hammer and chisel directly to the blade just means you end up with two neatly-sliced halves of a chisel.\n"
"\n"
"Obviously it would be of great interest to us if we could create our own knives made from these materials, with edges tapering to the width of a single molecule. My team and I believe it may now be possible.\n"
"\n"
"If you give us the funding and lab time we need, we can design and create a new monomolecular combat knife that will even the playing field for our soldiers when forced into hand-to-hand combat. This knife will be far more compact than the Kerrblade and much easier for humans to wield, and it'll be small enough to be used one-handed.\n"
"\n"
"Equipping our troops with such weapons could give them a major advantage, as they'll be able to properly defend themselves in melee for the first time whilst using other weapons or equipment -- such as pistols, grenades, medikits, or other useful items of tactical or life-saving importance.\n"

"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"The Iranian ADA 22 flamethrower (nicknamed 'The Torch of God' by Alliance troops) is a marvel of modern engineering. Unlike the old flamethrowers of the 20th century, it requires no heavy pressure tanks to be carried on a soldier's back -- the ADA is one unit carried in the hands without any hoses or tubes. It simply slots a relatively small 200mm gas canister into the feed, fires its deadly ammunition, and then ejects the empty canister to make room for a reload. The system is ingenious and surprisingly reliable.\n"
"\n"
"The muzzle of the weapon is a powerful pump that squirts gas into the air, then sets off the gas-air mixture by way of four parallel spark igniters, one main unit and three backups. These igniters each emit as many as ten sparks per second in order to ignite the fuel before it disperses. The backups are very important in preventing an explosion due to the special fuel the ADA uses, a substance called Compound 90.\n"
"\n"
"Compound 90 is a new flamethrower fuel that, when injected into the air, creates a slow thermobaric reaction -- a fuel-air ignition rather than a fuel-air explosion -- that can roast living tissue in seconds. C90 inflicts horrific damage on organic targets; the heat generated exceeds 1700 degrees celsius, enough to melt titanium. However, due to its gaseous nature it leaves no burning residue (like napalm) on the target or in the surrounding area and disperses its heat much more quickly. This makes it significantly safer for urban use than napalm-derivative substances.\n"
"\n"
"The ADA 22's main drawbacks are its short range and its complex internals, which are difficult to repair. However, our experienced technicians should have no problem doing maintenance on this model.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this flamethrower the classification CRC-FL.\n"

"\n"
"The flashbang is a non-lethal grenade that produces a blinding flash and a deafening blast to temporarily confuse or disorient targets in the area of effect. The grenade body does not explode or fragment upon detonation. In fact, if the body remains undamaged, it can be easily refilled and used again.\n"
"\n"
"Humans affected by a flashbang suffer temporary deafness and impaired balance, as well as complete loss of eyesight for up to five seconds before the effect fades and vision returns to normal. This makes the flashbang an excellent weapon for distracting and temporarily disabling the enemy, especially when assaulting heavily-defended positions. From combat reports, we've concluded that flashbangs have much the same effect on aliens as they do on humans; alien targets are effectively blind and deaf for a short time after the flashbang is deployed, rendering them helpless. We can't say exactly how long this period is, and it will undoubtedly vary from alien to alien, but it's still long enough to make the difference in a firefight.\n"
"\n"
"Aside from being a useful tactical tool, the flashbang will allow our soldiers to get in close and personal without being cut to shreds by the alien weapons. It allows the commander to choose exactly which weapons are applied in a given situation whilst avoiding the collateral damage potential of a frag grenade. A very quick enemy can take precautions to negate flashbang effects simply by closing his eyes and plugging his ears, but he will have very little warning and in most cases will require special training to respond in time. From what we can tell the aliens have had no prior experience with this type of weapon and have no defensive doctrine against it. Even a prepared enemy will still be distracted by a flashbang and could be engaged by fast-action troops before being able to reclaim his weapon and take aim.\n"
"\n"

"The flashbang does no physical damage to anyone caught in its area of effect, and for that reason alone this weapon should be used over frag grenades and other explosive ordnance during any mission where civilians are placed at risk.\n"

"It is an indispensible weapon in any terrain that features large amounts of available cover. If aliens are lying in wait and charging around a corner might be suicide, the mere act of popping a flashbang down the corridor can significantly change the outcome of the ensuing firefight in favour of our troops. Its utility is not to be underestimated.\n"

"The concept of the fragmentation grenade has changed little since it was first conceived, when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or metal containers. It only solidified further after the end of the 20th century. Improvements in explosive technology and casing materials have made them a little faster and a little deadlier, but the mechanics are the same: An explosive substance at the heart of the grenade causes the casing (and possibly additional payload such as a layer of wire or white phosphorus coiled around the explosive) to fragment into shrapnel and fly in all directions at high speed, killing or wounding targets in the area of effect. The delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and then releasing the handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It will detonate after a period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX purposes, we have selected the Australian HG15 as the best of the lot. This grenade is loaded with an extremely conventional charge of C8 solid chemical explosive, an inner layer of coiled wire, and an outer layer of thin plated steel. It's designed to maximise coverage by putting out more shrapnel than any other grenade on the market. The HG15's outer layer is smooth and unbroken, unlike the old 'pineapple' grenades of World War 2, to make it easier to roll across various surfaces. The C8 explosive at its core may be old in design, but it's both highly powerful and can be counted on to work right under harsh conditions. Reliability is an especially important attribute in any kind of hand-held bomb.\n"

"\n"
"Care should be taken that no friendlies (especially civilians) are caught in the area of effect. In such situations the use of lethal grenades is strongly discouraged; flashbangs should be given preference.\n"

"First released on the open market in 2047, the Brazilian RA6 has received numerous upgrades over the years that have kept it at the top of its field. It is the most widely-used infantry grenade launcher in use today because of its excellent reliability and low weight. It has an impressive selection of compatible cartridges in the popular 25mm calibre.\n"
"\n"
"The RA6 carries up to 9 grenades individually loaded into a simple rotary cylinder. The cylinder is hinged at the front and breaks open to accept reloads. Reloading individual grenades can be a slow and agonising process, but this is often the best way of going about it; while 25mm speedloaders do exist and will work on the RA6, they are bulky and hard to carry around.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon has two fire modes; timed shot, which will detonate grenades at a set time after leaving the barrel, and airburst, which will detonate grenades in the air after they have travelled a certain distance. The RA6's maximum rate of fire is one round per second on semi-automatic, or it can rapidly cycle through its cylinder on burst mode, firing quick three-round bursts that can devastate whole areas.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for the RA6 is the 25mm HIT (High Impulse Thermobaric) grenade, which is a 'fuel-air munition' that uses atmospheric oxygen to generate an explosion instead of carrying along an oxidising agent. Thermobaric weapons produce a far more powerful explosive force than would be possible with conventional explosives of the same size. They rely on explosive energy, concussion and heat for their lethality rather than on fragmentation like most conventional explosives.\n"
"\n"
"This is one of the most versatile and effective weapons on our roster. While not as powerful as the rocket launcher, it is a reliable support weapon and infantry artillery piece.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this grenade launcher the classification HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPGL is a tactician's dream come true. It has excellent damage and range, can hit several clustered targets with one blast, and can be used for special tasks such as area denial with incendiary grenades. It can be as effective in close situations as it is in large open spaces; however, different tactics are required.\n"
"\n"
"The airburst mode is preferable for use in open ground; it sacrifices some range by taking away the 'bounce' factor, but this also has its benefits. The bounce factor can seriously foul accuracy if the grenade lands on an uneven surface and can allow the enemy to run away or take cover before detonation. Airburst fire also allows the operator to place his grenades exactly where he wants them. Unless there is a catastrophic detonator failure, any airburst fired from the HPGL will go off at the intended spot with little chance for mechanical error.\n"
"\n"
"In close situations, timed grenades can be bounced off walls and around corners to reach dangerous or inconvenient places that other weapons have trouble getting a bead on. However, care should be taken that the operator doesn't fire shots that leave himself or any friendly troops inside the blast radius. This would make the operator very unpopular with what's left of the team. Due to the bounce factor on timed grenades, they can also be a severe hazard to nearby civilians. Use of the grenade launcher in situations where civilians might become victim to collateral damage is strongly discouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For close-range emergency work -- for example if the operator has no sidearm -- the launcher can also be loaded with special 25mm flechette shells similar to our shotgun shells. These have less damage potential than shotgun shells due to their lower muzzle velocity, but they can still be deadly in close quarters and, unlike explosive grenades, are not a risk to the operator at short ranges.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

The only real challenge was to shrink the complex machinery enough to fit inside a standard 25mm shell. We've had to scale back the power of the plasma grenade somewhat in order to do that -- the hydrogen core of our new 25mm shell is a fair bit smaller, emitting less plasma than the alien hand grenade.

"Now that we're able to reproduce these alien plasma grenades, we've been looking into the possibility of adapting the technology to be fired from a grenade launcher. This would be a challenge, as the plasma hand grenades are significantly larger than 25mm, but we may be able to produce a scaled-back version that -- while not as powerful -- will have all the advantages of being fired from our standard HPGL Grenade Launcher.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created not only to find the right weapons to combat the alien threat, but also to find armour and other items of battlefield utility to help our soldiers complete their missions and return to base alive. These items are designed to increase a soldier's combat effectiveness or general survivability.\n"
"\n"
"Infrared night-vision imaging has been used on battlefields for generations, and miniaturisation technology has allowed it to become part of a soldier's standard issue for nighttime operations. Advances in electronics over the last 30 years have allowed IR imaging equipment to shrink to the size of swimming goggles with no loss of efficiency.\n"
"\n"
"These goggles pick up all infrared emissions in the area and display them on the inside of the lenses. They can be easily worn for the duration of a nighttime engagement, greatly extending a soldier's visual range in the darkness and allowing him to see targets through thin walls. Thick walls present a greater obstacle and may obscure targets inside entirely. Of course, there is no way to distinguish between the IR signatures of civilians and those of aliens whenever we do not have direct line of sight. Any readings taken through walls or other obstacles will not be conclusive.\n"
"\n"
"Our IR goggles will work even during the day, though their effectiveness will be greatly reduced in daylight.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, this technology does have its drawbacks. Wearing goggles limits the soldier's peripheral vision and reduces hand-eye coordination, causing a slight drop in accuracy. They will hamper a soldier's eyesight as long as they are worn. Worse, our records from Mumbai confirm that some aliens with low heat emissions don't show up on infrared at all. Detection range for these aliens will actually be reduced, allowing them to sneak up on us if no other members of the team are in range to spot the approaching threat.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, these goggles will increase our nighttime performance exponentially, making night engagements much more survivable for our troops. However, they are not and will never be a foolproof substitute for the Mk. 1 Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"We should use these items sparingly and tactically to avoid costly mistakes. It is recommended that no more than half the team wear goggles during an engagement in order to avoid surprises. Two-man fireteams -- one man equipped with goggles, one man with normal eyesight -- are recommended for maximum battlefield effectiveness.\n"
"\n"
"Using goggles during daytime is generally contraindicated, as they lose most of their utility in daylight conditions. The only reason to continue wearing them under such conditions is their limited ability to see through walls.\n"
"\n"
"Close-range combat troops will suffer least from the accuracy penalty inflicted by IR goggles. However, longer-range shooters cannot afford this penalty, as a missed shot with one of these weapons may have dire consequences. Snipers in particular will have infrared laser targeting available via their scopes anyway.\n"

"Our analysis of the Kerrblade is complete, Commander. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade seems at first glance like the alien equivalent of our combat knife. Reality would be a better place if that were true. We've concluded it is much more than that, and the truth is far from comforting.\n"
"\n"
"Crafted from carbon alloy and alien plastics, it is surprisingly light and contains no metal whatsoever. The material itself is highly interesting for our weapons production. No matter how much we abuse it during testing, the blade will not chip, nick or bend. We think we might be able to duplicate the stuff with some more research.\n"
"\n"
"Its shape vaguely resembles the old curved swords from human history, though perhaps it has more relation to something out of fantasy fiction. It's too large, unwieldy and poorly balanced for the human hand. The blade, however, tapers to an incredible edge; we have measured it to be only one molecule wide. This gives the Kerrblade its fantastic cutting power.\n"
"\n"
"In our battlefield footage, we've seen the Kerrblade used with a curious, long-fingered grip -- one which the human hand is unable to duplicate -- that seems to indicate the Kerrblade is used as something other than a purpose-designed weapon. The closest analogies we've been able to find on Earth are those of a surgeon's scalpel and certain ancient disemboweling tools. This comparison was one of our first clues as to the true purpose of the Kerrblade. We put this together with some gruesome camera footage from Mumbai, which was so grainy that we could only guess what the aliens were doing, until now.\n"
"\n"
"The Kerrblade is, in fact, an autopsy tool. It's used by the aliens to cut up live or dead humans and extract whatever tissue or organ they like. The large, sharp spike at the bottom of the blade is inserted into the solar plexus, then moved upwards like a pair of scissors, or a can opener. It goes through the sternum with disturbing ease. At this point the alien will fold open the ribcage and rip or cut out whatever he needs.\n"
"\n"
"I wish we could just burn the things, but unfortunately they're too damned valuable. Though not primarily designed as weapons these Kerrblades are far more effective than any human combat knife. They cut up aliens almost as well as humans. The grip is highly uncomfortable for human hands, but we can adapt human grips easily enough. However, the blades are too big to ever fit into the standard-issue PHALANX holster. They can only be kept in a soldier's hands or in the backpack. This somewhat defeats the purpose of a knife -- but obviously we have no other melee weapon that even comes close in terms of power.\n"

"Commander, we've recovered an interesting alien weapon from the battlefield. It looks to be some kind of knife or sword with an edge sharper than anything on Earth. It can slice steel like tissue paper and goes through our soldiers' body armour as if it wasn't even there. The troops have named it the 'Kerrblade' after the distinctive sound it makes when shredding our armour.\n"
"\n"
"We should examine the blade to determine its function and see how it was made. There may be a way to duplicate this technology in a form that's compatible for human use, which would make melee engagements with alien combatants far more survivable than going at them with a combat knife.\n"

"Commander, I apologise in advance if my typing isn't up to standard in this message. We've had a lot of sleepless nights down here in DivEngine working on the laser pistol project. It's been a gruelling amount of work, but I'm very proud to say that we've pulled it off. We have prototyped a working laser pistol.\n"
"\n"
"The system is essentially the same as the one I've outlined for you in my report on Continuous Wave Laser Operation. Excited molecules of deuterium fluoride are lased and focused through a series of intelligent lenses. Waste gases are put through our custom filtering system, which we've scaled down even further. However, the reduced capacity of the filtering system and the smaller optical resonator have demanded some tradeoffs.\n"
"\n"
"The laser pistol can only lase deuterium-fluoride at about half the rate as our old Continuous Wave Laser prototype. Naturally this produces only a half-strength beam, doing half the damage of a larger weapon. It requires a period of continuous exposure -- several seconds at least -- for the beam to inflict enough damage to kill an unarmoured target. Armour will complicate the issue even further, and it's impossible for lasers to shoot through clouds of smoke, gas or fire. Still, as long as the target isn't obscured or immune to highly-focused light or heat, the laser will burn through anything given enough time.\n"
"\n"
"All the usual advantages of laser weaponry are present in the pistol. It's very quick to fire, and if the soldier misses his target at first, he can adjust his aim without letting go of the trigger. And there's another bonus particular to our pistol design. Thanks to the extremely high accuracy inherent in laser weaponry, it will be easy for ambidextrous soldiers to use two laser pistols at once.\n"
"\n"
"We've designed the pistol to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges which we've drawn up to power all of our laser weaponry. This means it uses the same amount of D-F as the larger designs, but uses it up at a much lower rate, effectively giving the laser pistol more ammunition than any of our other laser weapons.\n"
"\n"
"As with all handguns, the laser pistol is strictly a backup weapon. It isn't powerful enough to compete with rifles of any kind. On the other hand, the laser pistol completely eliminates the problems regarding range and accuracy that plague conventional handguns. Its range is quite impressive indeed for a handgun. It can shoot out to 60 metres with pinpoint accuracy thanks to the aim-correcting lenses, and it can fire continuously for minutes without reloading. This will make it particularly valuable in wide open terrain.\n"
"\n"
"We will need to have at least one D-F Cartridge on hand at all times in order to be able to load and use a laser pistol.\n"

"Our notes on Continuous Wave Laser Operation have produced a lot of designs, and this is possibly the most difficult one to bring into reality: a deuterium-fluoride laser weapon the size of an ordinary pistol.\n"
"\n"
"The difficulty in making this a reality will be to get the parts small enough and light enough so that they will:\n"

We've eliminated several moving parts and refined the electronics to bring production and maintenance costs down into our budget range. I believe you'll find the weapon's specs to your satisfaction.\n"
"\n"
"This rifle is possibly the most accurate weapon ever designed. It's light, rests easily in the shooter's hands, and the focusing lenses automatically correct the user's aim to help bring the beam on target -- and keep it there. It may inflict less damage per shot than its conventional projectile-firing counterparts, but it can do more over time if the shooter keeps the target in his sights. Eight troops with conventional assault rifles firing away at full-auto can easily miss a moving target. With laser rifles, that becomes a near-impossibility.\n"
"\n"
"It is quick to fire, has a good magazine capacity, no recoil, a respectable range and does away with many other issues that plague conventional firearms. It will never misfire or suffer a jammed mechanism. It will never blow up due to a fouled or bent barrel. It will never have problems with incompatible or faulty ammunition. It can suffer cracked lenses if subjected to severe mistreatment, but those are thoroughly shielded, set into shock-resistant foam and protected from the outside by a metal iris that only opens when the weapon is ready to fire.\n"
"\n"
"The laser rifle's biggest weakness is its inability to shoot through clouds of smoke, gas or fire. All our lasers have this problem; clouds of material will quickly refract the beam into harmless light, so we'll have to be careful about our application of smoke and incendiary weapons.\n"
"\n"
"We've designed the rifle to use the standard deuterium-fluoride cartridges which we've drawn up to power all of our laser weaponry. This gives it approximately two minutes of continuous wave fire before a new cartridge must be inserted. The cartridges can be popped out and left on the ground without risk of contaminating the area, but they will require special hazard disposal once the mission is completed.\n"

Even on paper the laser rifle's specs can compete with any conventional assault rifle. The only problem will be actually building it.\n"
"\n"
"The components we've been using in our Continuous Wave Laser prototypes have been cumbersome, fragile and very expensive. Our soldiers need ruggedness in a rifle, something that will last through the bumps and bashes of combat, and we badly need to bring down production costs to make the program worthwhile. As it is, the price of a squad of working laser rifles would be on par with your average main battle tank. We need funding and lab time to bring costs down, fix or replace the most sensitive components to make the weapon more reliable, and reduce its form factor to something that can be comfortably fired by a human soldier.\n"

"Commander, our heavy laser program has been a success. We've got it prototyped and ready to go into production at your say-so.\n"
"\n"
"As promised, the heavy laser is a revolution in our heavy weapons arsenal. In the hands of a qualified soldier, it can provide long-range continuous wave fire that is both far more accurate than conventional heavy weapons and far more powerful than our other infantry laser designs. We in DivEngine have no doubt that it will serve a vital role throughout the war.\n"
"\n"
"This is not to say the heavy laser doesn't have its downsides. For one, it's very bulky and very heavy, requiring a strong troop to shoot it effectively. It doesn't sacrifice accuracy despite its size, but it's less quick to fire or respond than we would like, and its ammo consumption is staggering. It can chew through a full deuterium-fluoride cartridge in only 30 seconds of continuous fire. This requires a large number of magazines to be kept on hand, and the heavy laser is not particularly quick to reload.\n"
"\n"
"Another weakness is the fact that the heavy laser cannot shoot through clouds of smoke, gas or fire. All our lasers have this problem; clouds of material will quickly refract the beam into harmless light, so we'll have to be careful about our application of smoke and incendiary weapons. Great care will also have to be taken that no bystanders or PHALANX troops get into the path of the invisible beam. Even momentary exposure to an unobstructed beam will char bone and liquefy flesh. A hit to the eyes will result in permanent, irreparable blindness. We've talked to our training and field officers about this and have underlined safety in our field manual at every turn, but it won't hurt the troops to hear it again from you, Commander.\n"
"\n"
"Robotic or armoured aliens may be able to survive a beam for some time, even from a heavy laser, before their armour fails. It's recommended to engage these with several soldiers at once and concentrate fire in order to bring them down as quickly as possible.\n"
"\n"
"It's also recommended that you not replace all our conventional heavy weapons with heavy lasers, Commander. We need a good balance of weapons to play to the strengths of our troops and to the weaknesses of the aliens. A varied arsenal is a healthy arsenal, and can't be easily defended against.\n"

However, this will require significant research and refining of our prototype, as well as enlarging several of the components. The result will be a strictly heavy-infantry weapon of about the same size and weight as our HPML Rocket Launcher.\n"
"\n"
"We estimate that this weapon could be invaluable in a fire support role or as a direct-fire blockade breaker, capable of dissolving enemy strongpoints with powerful, pinpoint accurate fire. It would have attributes and capabilities which may be lacking in our current heavy weapons arsenal. Accuracy at range is generally abysmal in Earth-built heavy weapons, and they can be difficult to employ in situations where we need to avoid collateral damage. The heavy laser would avoid these issues altogether.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several micrometres in diameter which can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we can make it.\n"

"\n"
"This plasma pistol is a nasty piece of work, Commander. Its operation is extremely complex and inventive, requiring a great deal of technical skill to create. The power pack alone is hundreds of years ahead of our technology. It stores enough power to heat several charges of hydrogen to a plasmatic state inside the miniature fusion chamber, which are expelled as plasma using the ionised particles' own velocity.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike human firearms, the projectiles themselves are not stored in a magazine or reservoir. They are generated inside the pistol from hydrogen contained in the magazine, powered by the magazine's power-pack. Once the plasma is heated, a thin film of liquid plastic is created between the two 'spinnerets' located vertically opposite each other in front of the grip. The plasma particles are then rapidly fired into the film so that the plastic deforms into an orb or 'bolt'. The plastic contains and protects the plasma, keeping it from dispersing until it reaches the target. By the time a bolt reaches the target, the inside of the plastic will be so eaten away that it will burst upon impact like a soap bubble, splashing its payload across the target. The maximum range of a pistol bolt -- the point it can reach before the plasma eats into open air and disperses -- is approximately 20 metres.\n"
"\n"
"A bolt fired from the plasma pistol is so hot that even a near-miss can be lethal. The effects on a victim are truly horrific; I will try to list them all here.\n"
"\n"
"Any unarmoured human sprayed with this plasma will suffer extreme pain and injuries all across the splash zone. Adipose (fatty) tissue will melt like water. Blood and other bodily fluids boil in place. The plasma will actually eat its way into a human body, causing bone-deep charring in a large region around the splash zone. A large chunk of the body will be literally burnt to a crisp.\n"
"\n"
"Any kind of tough fabric will provide some protection against a plasma hit. High-tech armour in particular will disperse the heat as best it can, and will resist the burning plasma for a time. Hopefully this will be enough time to allow air-cooling to take place, bringing the plasma down to non-lethal temperatures.\n"

"I won't pretend to know how the aliens managed to squeeze all this stuff into a pistol, but it does look as though they've made the same tradeoffs between power and size that we have done with our handguns. It's almost certain that larger, more powerful versions of these weapons exist and will appear against us in this war.

Ballistic testing has confirmed that blaster shots can reach distances of up to 400m before dispersing. The accuracy may be poor, but the blaster also has a far higher rate of fire. A heavy-duty plasma chamber and upgraded plastic spinnerets can produce up to 250 rounds per minute. Unfortunately for us, despite the containment plastic's increased thickness, the bolts will still burst and deploy their plasma properly even at extreme close range. This makes the blaster highly dangerous at all ranges at which PHALANX troops may encounter it. We recommend that any enemies found carrying one be neutralised ASAP, as they are an extreme threat to everyone and everything in the line of fire.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to use the blaster mostly in the role of heavy machine gun and anti-vehicle weapon. Another interesting fact is that their use is almost completely exclusive to the Ortnok species. Most Tamans -- like most humans -- would have extreme difficulty trying to lift and aim one and require mechanical assistance to do so. Cybernetic enhancements and/or the development of powered armour would certainly rectify many of the blaster's inherent weaknesses from a human point of view.\n"
"\n"
"Lastly, we've mapped out the weapon's full control scheme for you, which is documented in the attached field manual. Our troops should now be able to train with and use the plasma blaster in combat as any other weapon, provided they're able to lift it.\n"

"Commander, we've figured out the secrets of the alien weapon. I'm afraid the news is not good.\n"
"\n"
"We were wrong to think of the plasma blade as a knife. In essence, it is a one-shot anti-armour weapon, like the Panzerfaust of WW2, except designed to kill armoured infantry and small vehicles rather than tanks.\n"
"\n"
"It's shaped like a knife handle with no blade. In place of the blade it has a small black nozzle with a large plastic ring around it. There is no visible trigger or activation button. Instead, it's armed by twisting the handle, and subsequently fired by bringing the nozzle within several centimetres of a reasonably flat surface. Only then does the plasma blade go to work.\n"
"\n"
"The plastic ring around the nozzle ejects a charge of sticky foam which hardens almost instantly to the strength of concrete. At this point the weapon is locked firmly to the target and an airtight seal is created. There is only vacuum between the nozzle and the target. All the while, a jet of plasma has been heating up inside the handle, which is now let loose and shot into the target at a fraction of the speed of light. Plasma and hot shrapnel begin bouncing around inside the armour, tearing up circuits or flesh.\n"
"\n"
"There is no armour that can withstand this weapon. If a proper seal is achieved, the target has no hope of survival. The plasma blade's only saving grace is that it's not very accurate, and while it can be thrown, its chances of achieving a seal when thrown are very slim. Planting one by hand has a much higher chance of success. If an alien manages to rush our troops while wielding a plasma blade, anything in the immediate area will be in danger. All available fire should be brought to bear to neutralise the target before it has the chance to hit anyone.\n"
"\n"
"This weapon frightens me, Commander. Its very existence implies a lot of things. Combined with the aliens' usual pragmatism with regards to their own lives, it says to me that they may be prepared to employ kamikaze tactics, sacrificing their own lives just to kill one of us. 1 human for 1 alien is a ratio that neither PHALANX nor humanity can possibly afford. Even if it was closer to 10: 1 I still wouldn't fancy our chances. After all, how many of them are there?\n"

"Commander, our assessment of the alien plasma grenade is complete. Like all the alien weapons, it's very nasty and very dangerous.\n"
"\n"
"The device is essentially made up of seven components: a casing, a trigger, a battery, a timer, an explosive charge, a plasma chamber and a solid hydrogen core. The casing is specially shaped to create a toroidal blast zone around the grenade, concentrating power into a smaller area. The battery is highly powerful and barely within our power to duplicate. The trigger is of particular interest, because it contains a tiny thumbprint scanner which verifies that the grenade is not being accidentally activated. A legitimate (i.e. non-accidental) activation starts the timer countdown. The length of the countdown is variable depending on the number of seconds that the trigger is held down, but it has a built-in safe minimum of three seconds.\n"
"\n"
"Once the timer reaches zero, the battery unleashes its power, heating a core of hydrogen to plasma in milliseconds. The explosive charge sends the grenade tumbling into the air, and once the grenade achieves vertical orientation and ideal height, the plasma chamber containment is switched off. Rapid expansion of the plasma causes the casing to burst, spraying high-velocity fragments and plasma particles all over the area of effect. Due to the unstable nature of uncontained plasma, the grenade has a limited blast radius, beyond which the plasma particles cool and slow down too much to be dangerous. This radius is approximately 50% larger than that of a standard human frag grenade.\n"
"\n"
"Anything caught within the area of effect will be either severely injured or dead.\n"

"Commander, here's my report on our alien plasma rifle research.\n"
"\n"
"At its most basic level, the plasma rifle is little more than an upscaled version of the plasma pistol. However, as any firearms fanatic will tell you, pistols are pistols and rifles are rifles. Handguns are small, personal defence weapons. Rifles are weapons of war. The disparity in power is remarkable.\n"
"\n"
"Rifle plasma is over 20% hotter than pistol plasma and capable of burning through even heavy armour. The plastic globes containing the rifle's plasma shots are much thicker than the pistol's, only beginning to disintegrate at distances between 80-100m. This is a short maximum range for a general-purpose assault rifle, but ideal for urban infantry engagements and other close-quarters work. The bolts do not suffer from projectile drop and they're far too massive to be affected by wind conditions. This makes the plasma rifle highly accurate at all ranges.\n"
"\n"
"The scariest new feature of this weapon is the fact that it is capable of automatic fire. Its rate of fire on full-auto may not be very high -- approx. 180 rounds per minute -- and the recoil is difficult to handle, but it more than makes up for these failings with sheer power. Two or three solid plasma rifle hits are usually all it takes to kill a human in light or medium-grade armour. An unarmoured soldier has no hope at all.\n"
"\n"
"We've figured out the controls on the rifle and written up a manual for field use. Our troops should be able to make good use of it.\n"
"\n"
"There can be no doubt that this weapon was designed and manufactured for war, and not in any defensive capacity. The aliens clearly know armed conflict very well. The rifle's power and lethality do not imply that they invaded us because of some mistake or misunderstanding. They came to Earth with a plan, Commander, and that really scares me.\n"

msgstr ""
"Commander, we've finished analysing the alien needler gun, and I've prepared a threat assessment and technical overview for you.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned in my research proposal, the needler is indeed a type of sniper rifle, but an unusual one. It ignores the normal concept of firing powerful slugs to make single, long-range kills. Instead it vomits out hundreds and hundreds of ultra-fast silicon steel needles which can easily tear apart a target at any range.\n"
"\n"
"The needles are fired by a fast-changing magnetic field inside the barrel, hooked up to a feed mechanism that injects thousands of needles a minute into the barrel. This creates a near-constant stream of fire which lasts for as long as you hold down the trigger and the magazine holds out. Unlike bullets, these needles have a practically flat trajectory from muzzle to target. They punch through most armour like it doesn't exist. They're so low in mass that there's little appreciable recoil when firing, giving them excellent accuracy, but at the same time thin enough to avoid being overly affected by weather. Wind, rain and physical obstructions can knock some of the needles off course but not enough to make the weapon much less effective.\n"
"\n"
"One of the main components that caught my attention is the powerful electromagnet array. It's laid out as a 'coilgun', many electromagnetic coils wrapped around the barrel, a method we'd previously thought to be too energy-inefficient to use on the battlefield. The aliens seem to have made it viable through clever use of superconductors and alien engineering. We may be able to adapt this technology to our own EM weapons research, I'll take a closer look and get back to you when I have anything concrete.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of an ordinary top-mounted sniper scope, the aliens have incorporated a highly effective holographic aiming mechanism and rangefinder which projects directly in front of the user's leading eye. Targets are shown with absolute clarity at any range, the sight automatically compensates for natural body motions, and it will even tell the user the exact chances of scoring a hit at any time. We've run this thing by our own troops and -- once they got used to it -- the alien holo-sight was the preferred choice by an amazing 100% compared to our own scopes. If we can adapt and duplicate this sight in a self-contained package, we could create the ultimate aiming unit to use on any of our rifles, possibly even some handguns.\n"
"\n"
"Equipped with a bipod for prone firing and a very large magazine, the needler is a serious threat to our troops. Snipers can inflict serious casualties on exposed troops and we cannot afford the losses. If a needler is spotted, our soldiers will have to make optimal use of cover and try to flank whilst staying out of sight. A direct assault on an entrenched needler gun will likely prove suicidal and I don't recommend anyone to try it, Commander.\n"

"Commander, I'd like to present you with the finished plans and prototype for our Coilgun.\n"
"\n"
"Combining an alien-inspired power pack and coil arrangement with some of our Bolter technology has solved many of the coilgun design's inherent problems. A hundred years ago, the energy efficiency of coilguns measured less than 2%; meaning, the energy of the projectile at the time of impact was less than 2% of the energy used to fire it. Even with today's technology coilgun efficiency is limited to single digits, but the alien Needler manages efficiency ratings as high as 70%. It may take us years to get to that level, but with the Coilgun we've developed something that is both practical and effective for the war effort.\n"
"\n"
"In order to get better acceleration out of the coils, we've created a new kind of ammunition, based on the aliens' needle alloy. In shape it's a fairly standard fin-stabilised penetrator inside a discarding sabot, but it's made from materials never before seen on Earth. Discarding sabot rounds are normally used for much larger calibres -- we've effectively scaled down an anti-tank round -- but the armour-piercing potential is phenomenal, higher than any other weapon we have. In fact, the Coilgun is now the highest-calibre infantry weapon on the planet.\n"
"\n"
"We've also incorporated a Needler-style holographic sight, making the Coilgun extremely accurate and comfortable to fire.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of a coilgun as a sniper rifle are obvious. There's no rush of propellant to make noise, no muzzle flash spitting out light and heat. Unlike even our Bolter, nothing comes out the barrel except the bullet -- there's no spray of hot metal from the rails to light up the sniper on infrared. With nothing to reveal the sniper's position except the noise of the bullet itself breaking the sound barrier, it's possible to fire and stay undetected, even against alien technology. Best of all, ballistics tests confirm that it should be able to bring down most aliens in a single shot.\n"
"\n"
"Of course we've had to make some sacrifices -- high weight due to the coils and electrical equipment contained in the barrel, low ammunition capacity due to the high calibre, large and heavy magazines/power packs. Despite this, I believe the Coilgun should replace most of our SR-1 Sniper Rifles, as it's proving difficult for our conventional weapons to compete with new enemy armour designs.\n"
"\n"
"Keep the SR-1 in light sniper and anti-infantry roles and move the Coilgun forward as our main long-range threat. The aliens will come to fear it.\n"

When combining the alien fast-changing magnetic generators -- and, even more importantly, their power source -- with human-engineered EM rifle technology, some amazing man-portable weaponry becomes possible. I'd hereby like to propose a new design for a coilgun in the role of a sniper rifle.\n"
"\n"
"The Needler is a terrific weapon, but there are undeniable advantages to delivering one large slug compared to a number of smaller flechettes; greater stability in flight, better armour-piercing ability, and above all superior stopping power. There's a reason why our sniper doctrine calls for one shot to a kill, that the target should be dead before he even knows the sniper is there.\n"

"To this end we plan to adapt the electromagnetic equipment and power source from the Needler to a larger barrel and a more human-friendly shape, as well as developing a new slug to maximise damage potential.

The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

It is a significant competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for sheer short-range devastation. Its speed combined with flechette ammo makes for a deadly mix that can be relied upon to quickly dispatch any enemy stupid enough to get into range.\n"

"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"

"Designed and manufactured in mainland China, the Ohm 55 SMG is one of the most frightening weapons to come out of the Second Cold War. It was first prototyped in 2035 by scientists working for the Communist Chinese government. Production models were only trickling into government units by the end of the war, but the rebel and Commonwealth troops quickly learned to respect the Ohm's ferocity.\n"
"\n"
"Its rate of fire at full auto exceeds 1200 rounds per minute. It can chew through a 50-round magazine in three seconds. It fires an upgraded version of the Belgian 5.7mm armour-piercing round, a steel penetrator with aluminium core, which can tear kevlar like paper and tumbles brutally through flesh and bone. Even modern ballistic fibre cannot stop this round at anything closer than 12 metres. The Ohm 55 has dominated the field of SMGs for the past 50 years and will continue to do so for at least the next decade.\n"
"\n"
"The Ohm is highly manoeuvrable with a short barrel and sleek lines, but can suffer from excessive muzzle climb on full auto due to the sheer weight of lead the weapon puts out. Autofire also tends to empty the magazine before the shooter even realises he's holding down the trigger. Still, after nearly 50 years in service around the world, this remains the Ohm 55's only known design flaw.\n"

"For PHALANX use, we have given this submachine gun the classification CRC-8.\n"

"\n"
"The CRC-8 is intended for point-blank urban firefights. It will perform very well in this role, but don't expect it to hit the broad side of a barn out to medium range. It can also function as a high-powered sidearm, but may be too bulky for most soldiers to use in this manner.\n"
"\n"
"While the CRC-8 does suffer excessive muzzle climb on full auto, throwing off the aim of even experienced users, it is much more docile in its standard burst mode. Full auto should rarely be considered outside of panic situations.\n"

"The 'Artificial Fog' smoke grenade was developed by the African league of nations during the war on the diamond cartels. It is an ingenious design which proves that, even in the age of electronic perception, the smoke grenade hasn't outlived its usefulness. There is no vision system that cannot be defeated somehow, and upgraded smoke grenades like the Artificial Fog grenade can block infrared sighting equipment as easily as they block the Mk. 1 Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"The Artificial Fog grenade is what is called a 'bursting' smoke grenade. Instead of pouring smoke out of holes in the top, it bursts apart much like an incendiary grenade and covers a large area of ground with titanium tetrachloride, which quickly produces vast clouds of corrosive white smoke. It also fills the air with minuscule 'chaff', flakes of iron that refract radar waves and generally muck up the electronic picture of the battlefield. Other trace additives to the smoke help refract most of the non-visible EM spectrum. Even alien technology has trouble sifting through the thick soup.\n"

"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) cartridge, fed by 5-round magazines which can weigh as much as one kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows quick repeated shots on semi-automatic without any loss of accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the LRWS is only effective out to approximately 1 kilometre -- barely a third of the range of a standard anti-materiel rifle -- but we estimate that PHALANX should never face a situation where this might become a problem. Its reduced accuracy is amended by a highly-advanced scope that will calculate and display intelligent bullet trajectories wherever the rifle is pointing.\n"
"\n"
"The integral 'smart' bipod features a pneumatic suspension system that keeps the barrel perfectly horizontal to allow accurate fire even on broken ground. The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any shooter. Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in Mumbai than any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
"\n"
"At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, the LWRS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require. This weapon will not disappoint.\n"

"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Soldiers equipped with the S-1should keep their distance, fire from cover, and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic weapon; a missed shot wastes time, ammunition and possibly life.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"

"We've achieved results in our effort to create anti-alien chemicals that can be effectively used on the battlefield. One agent in particular has been classified as fully combat-capable and is ready to be deployed at your say-so.\n"
"\n"
"The agent in question is a cocktail of bleach, mustard gas, titanium tetrachloride and several other nasty compounds, combining to form a substance we like to call \"CHOKE\". It is a highly powerful blistering agent that reacts with organic skin in seconds rather than hours. It reacts violently with air to provide several minutes of gas coverage over a small, concentrated area.\n"
"\n"
"The effects on organic tissue are harsh. Even minor contact with the skin or mucous membranes will cause severe irritation, resulting in restricted breathing and excruciating pain. Contact with the eyes can cause prolonged, even permanent blindness if left untreated. The agony caused by CHOKE is so acute and disabling that it will knock the fight out of almost anything with which it comes into contact. Our organic alien captives have all demonstrated very satisfying responses; most targets go into shock and exhibit little to no motor control until dosed up with painkillers and anti-CHOKE medication. Their breathing apparatus offers no defence whatsoever against an agent which doesn't need to enter the lungs.\n"
"\n"
"CHOKE is equally effective against humans. Volunteer testing has left battle-hardened soldiers hunched on the floor in a foetal position, frozen in place and barely able to breathe. Two subjects had to be rushed to hospital due to blistering of the lungs and fluid buildup, but I'm happy to report both will survive. It is however recommended that our troops be kept away from any deployed CHOKE at all times. If one of our troops does manage to come into contact with it, we've loaded our medikits with the appropriate drugs to treat and revive.\n"
"\n"
"The only defence against CHOKE is full body coverage. Any exposed skin or breathing passage is a vulnerability, and so far the aliens have deployed no armour that would protect their troops against this kind of attack. As far as PHALANX agents are concerned, a full head-enclosing gas mask should protect them adequately, since our standard uniforms and armours provide airtight coverage of the soldier's body.\n"

"Our study of the various live and dead alien specimens we've recovered has been enlightening. Thanks to the discoveries we've made over the past few months, my team and I have come to believe that we're ready to start a bio/chemical warfare program against the alien threat. We have tissue samples, autopsy data, live specimens for testing; all the raw materials we require to investigate methods of properly incapacitating battlefield specimens without being forced to send PHALANX troops into melee combat.\n"

"We've finished prototyping our experimental electrical weapon, and it's now ready to begin full production.\n"
"\n"
"The concept of the stun rod, as we call it, requires no in-depth explanation. It's an electrical prod that delivers a stunning shock to anything that comes into contact with the prongs at the front of the weapon. The intensity of the shock can be easily set by the user; high-end shocks can temporarily overload the systems of alien robots and trigger a shutdown, but such powerful shocks delivered to organic enemies can be quite lethal. The stun rod is also more than capable of stunning or electrocuting any humans who get too close. Caution is recommended.\n"
"\n"
"The combat applications are simple. The soldier wielding it would enter into melee with an alien, bring the prongs into contact with the enemy's skin or armour, and pull the trigger. The ensuing electrical discharge would stun or disable the subject for some time, even through armour or protective skin. The period of unconsciousness will vary from species to species and between individuals, depending on their exposure, metabolism, mental state, and more. I'm afraid I cannot provide you with any hard numbers yet. However, we estimate the stun rod to give us more than enough time to secure the prisoner and render it harmless.\n"
"\n"
"We fully realise the difficulty of bringing the aliens to melee and then besting them. This is why we've armoured the stun rod's body to stand up against the Kerrblade without being sliced in two. It's designed to use as a staff or club in melee during an emergency, and it will not break, crack or become unreliable.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, with these heavy-duty batteries and electrical systems and additional armour, the stun rod has become a rather hefty weapon. It will require two hands to use effectively in combat as a prod or a blunt instrument, though it will not restrict grenade throwing or pistol use in the off hand.\n"
"\n"
"The outputs that the stun rod can deliver -- repeatedly -- make it the most powerful electrical weapon on Earth at this time. However, despite efforts to push our designs further, we don't yet have the technology to create ranged weapons that can match the stun rod's capabilities. Electrolasers are still too weak for their power consumption and wire-tasers can only be used once at limited ranges. We are however looking into adapting alien power cells for use in PHALANX-built electrolasers. This is a possibility that holds great promise for the future of our bio research.\n"

"Thank you for your indulgence in this program, Commander. I firmly believe this will be a great help to our capture efforts. Still, I will try to leave further technical matters with Cdr. Navarre, where they belong.\n"

"I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds, but I have an important technical research proposal to make, a proposal to create a new piece of PHALANX equipment for use by our field agents. I realise this falls outside the responsibilities of my division. However, I've already discussed things with Cdr. Navarre, and he doesn't quite see eye-to-eye with me on the necessity of the item in question. I had no choice but to go to straight to you with the proposal.\n"
"\n"
"As you know, we've yet to capture an alien alive during our tactical engagements in all the weeks we've been waging this war. Now that we know how to keep them alive in containment, our lack of specimens is becoming a serious impediment to our biological and chemical research. We need living tissue to study, performing its natural functions inside a living body, and we don't have the ability to simply clone up some aliens to research. We need prisoners. The sooner the better.\n"
"\n"
"That's why I would like to propose a simple but high-powered electrical shock weapon, not unlike a military stun gun, designed to disable our enemies without killing them. It would be a two-handed man-portable unit with a large battery and several charge settings, the highest of which should be sufficient even to disable alien robots such as the Bloodspider. We in DivBio believe that any alien subjected to this weapon would be disabled long enough for our soldiers to take control of the situation and secure prisoners.\n"
"\n"
"Cdr. Navarre, however, feels that such a weapon would be hazardous to our soldiers and \"a throwback to the 20th century\", and refuses to endorse it. He doesn't seem to understand. We have no alternative method of disabling enemies at the voltages required. Commander, we need this weapon as badly as we need live aliens from the field. We can't merely shoot them and hope to patch one or two up again upon return to base. Even if we succeeded in that mindset, my division's needs will be far, far higher than that for proper research and interrogation.\n"
"\n"
"I hope you understand. Please authorise lab time and funding for this project as soon as you can, and I'll get some people from DivEngine together to develop this project properly. I would of course be delighted if you could explain things to Cdr. Navarre. I'm sure he'll be happy to receive a message from you.\n"

"\n"
"Particle-beam weaponry is designed to hit a target object with a stream of accelerated particles moving at near-light velocities, therefore carrying tremendous kinetic energy. Until now we've only seen the aliens use this technology in large UFO weapons. Now, however, they're using it on the ground in the worst way.\n"
"\n"
"The pistol itself is quite simple in build, just a shell covering a set of magnets and electrostatic lenses for focusing and constricting the particle beam. This is all stuff we can duplicate easily with enough money and effort. However, we've yet to figure out the weapon's ammo supply. The energy readings we've taken from the magazines are extreme, and despite our efforts, we haven't managed to disable or disarm one in order to safely open it up. Even shooting it dry doesn't completely deactivate one of these magazines. More research will be required before we can try and understand them, much less reproduce them.\n"
"\n"
"Certainly this pistol is the nastiest handgun I've ever seen in my career, with impressive armour-piercing capabilities and extreme damage potential. The high-speed particle beam can kill a lightly-armoured human in one shot at ranges of up to 40 metres. Just one shot. With regards to lethality at range, it outperforms even our laser pistol. The only good news is that the PB pistol is significantly less accurate than our lasers and produce too much of a kick to make repeated accurate shots.\n"
"\n"
"In fact, firing the pistol may be difficult for troops with less than the required physical strength. The particles leaving the barrel move at a fraction of the speed of light, so they generate an unholy amount of recoil against the shooter. It would be an extreme challenge for weaker troops to keep the weapon on-target. If these pistols are deployed, we recommend they only be issued to the stronger troops on our squad.\n"

"This cannon has got to be the most powerful infantry particle beam the aliens can field, because I can't imagine them getting much bigger. Though smaller and lighter than the Plasma Blaster, the PB cannon's recoil is out of this world. It can blast a full grown man clean off his feet in one shot. No normal human will be able to use this weapon. We can adapt it for mounting on our UGVs, and we may be able to enhance our soldiers with cybernetic implants or powered armour, but that's all.\n"
"\n"
"As bad as the recoil is, the target will have it worse. A single fleeting hit -- a heartbeat of exposure -- will buckle three inches of homogenous steel and blow the target back by several metres.

"What first alarmed me about this weapon is its performance against our infantry armour. The high-energy particles in a particle beam travel so fast that the beam can easily punch a hole through our standard vehicle armour. When fired at a suit of Combat Armour, the results are gruesome. It penetrates the front of the armour without even slowing down, and still has enough power to punch out the back and continue for several metres before dispersing.\n"

"Commander, my method worked. I think we've managed to crack the secrets of the mysterious particle beam weaponry. Here are my conclusions.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of man-portable particle beam weaponry suggests a serious escalation in this war. Prior to being shot at with it, we had no idea that the aliens possessed such advanced technology, and we have no idea why it was not deployed before now. The aliens' motivations and strategy remain a complete mystery to us. Still, I don't believe I'm overstating the issue that these weapons change everything.\n"
"\n"
"When I try to describe this, you have to understand that I'm not talking about the actual weapons. As I've mentioned in my reports, the weapons themselves are basically nothing more than a metal shell around a set of magnets and electrostatic lenses, all used for focusing and constricting the particle beam. The real magic happens in a space about the size of my fist. I'm talking about what we have previously thought of as the 'magazine', until now. What it actually is is unbelievable.\n"
"\n"
"Each individual magazine is actually a synchrotron particle accelerator of mind-blowingly tiny proportions, wrapped around a battery pack so small that we can't even begin to imagine how they built it. The synchrotron speeds particles round and round in a very small circle -- less than the diameter of the magazine -- until they've achieved sufficient velocity. The particles are then diverted via a magnetic field into the focusing array, where they are magnetically constricted -- 'pinched' -- into a coherent beam.\n"
"\n"
"Commander, there is no chance in hell that we can build accelerators this complex this small. Not in our lifetimes. Neither we at PHALANX nor the rest of the world have the precision machinery or the knowledge necessary to duplicate the alien technology. We've documented how the weapons works, and they're simple enough to produce, but if we actually want to use them we're going to have to scrounge magazines off the aliens. Worse, these little accelerators are put under tremendous amounts of strain in their lifetimes, and they'll start to malfunction after being used only a few times. Our ammo supply will be spotty at best, limited to whatever we can recover in the field.\n"
"\n"
"If the aliens have widespread access to this sort of technology, and they obviously do, I couldn't tell you why they haven't just waltzed in and mashed humanity into paste. Their war machine is several orders of magnitude greater than ours. Their technology is more advanced, they have more numbers and better aircraft, and yet they're still coming at us in fits and starts. It's baffling. However, any good soldier will tell you that 'why' doesn't matter right now. They're the ones making the mistake and it's up to us to take advantage of it.\n"
"\n"
"We need to upgrade, upgun, and uptrain everything we have, Commander. Everything. We have to be ready before they start getting really serious about this war.\n"

"Commander, we've decided that more research is badly needed on the particle beam weaponry, especially their mysterious power source, the magazines which we've been utterly unable to examine. No amount of finesse or ingenuity has been able to open them. That's why I'm hereby proposing extreme measures.\n"
"\n"
"I want to use our lab's radiation chamber to bombard one of the magazines with electromagnetic pulses, destroying most of the internal electronics, and hopefully causing it to shut down. Once it's safely deactivated, we can use brute force to open it up.\n"
"\n"
"Destroying a magazine to find out how it works may seem crude and backwards, but we have no other choice at the moment. Even blasted to hell by EMP, it should help us answer a lot of questions about the aliens' particle beam technology. It may also give us clues as to how we can get inside an undamaged magazine.\n"
"\n"
"Once we know how the magazine works, we can reassess the weapons and we'll hopefully be able to tell you how it all fits together, Commander.\n"

"Commander, I would like to report the success of our nanocomposite production research!\n"
"\n"
"I won't bore you with the intricacies of CNT production; suffice it to say that, by close study of the telltale traces left by alien production lines, we've been able to identify some of their processes. Apparently they use some kind of plasma furnace in order to spin, shape and press the nanotubes into a latticework pattern. We've been able to create a prototype furnace of our own, and have made various modifications to our nanotube production methods based on the alien examples. The result is a significant increase in power efficiency and production volume.\n"
"\n"
"From here on I'll restrict my summary to the capabilities and tactical applications of the new armour, which I trust you will find both fascinating and encouraging.\n"
"\n"
"We've managed to duplicate almost all the functionality of the alien armour, from the nanocomposite plates to the servo-assisted movement. It is incredibly light for its bulk, though still considerably heavier than our Combat Armour. It is almost as protective as the alien model, and bestows similar quickness of movement and more precise aiming.\n"
"\n"
"However, there are some limitations that we just can't get around. The fact is that the aliens have a good deal more experience with these materials and can work them a lot more elegantly than we can. Our armour is bulkier and heavier, more stiffly-constructed, and its electronics do not perform as well. This may negatively impact firing speed and reaction time. Our version of the polymer isn't quite as good as theirs, it tends to crack more easily. Our servomotors in particular are large and unwieldy compared to the compact alien designs. There's no way to reduce their size any further than we already have.\n"
"\n"
"We're really quite embarrassed about the boots in particular, but they are honestly the best we could do. We simply don't have the precision machinery needed to make servos like the aliens do. Regardless, we've tried our best to make the boots safe and light, with a powerful suspension system in the soles to make them springy enough for rapid movement.\n"
"\n"
"The new armour's tactical applications are extensive. It's light enough to be worn by forward elements of our tac teams, yet protective enough to resist heavy weapons fire. It will serve exceptionally well for close assault troops that need both speed and armour to perform their best.\n"

"Our examination of the alien body armour has led us to many interesting realisations. Obviously, the key to creating more effective mobile armour based on the alien suits lies in the direction of nanocomposites. This will require large amounts of carbon nanotubes.\n"
"\n"
"In the past, carbon nanotubes have been difficult and expensive to produce, and trying to work them into a proper shape was even worse. Because of this nanocomposite armour has never been used except in high-cost vehicles such as aircraft and tanks, and then only in plating that requires minimal shaping or other work. The alien armour, however, uses carbon nanotube composites in abundance. It's our manufacturing processes that are holding us back.\n"
"\n"
"With the alien armour in hand and enough resources at our disposal, I believe that we can devise new production methods and shaping processes that will allow us to mass-produce shaped nanocomposite plates, finally bringing this technology into our reach.\n"

"Commander, we've got a full report on the alien armour for you.\n"
"\n"
"It was something of a surprise to learn that the alien armour is made of a composite of plastics and carbon containing no metal whatsoever. In fact, the most important element is something with which humanity is already well-acquainted: carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (also known as CNTs or 'buckytubes') are cylindrical carbon molecules that are incredibly strong, one of the strongest materials known to humankind. They have been relatively little-used on Earth because of their extreme cost. No economical means of mass-production has been found to date, restricting their use to the most expensive programs on Earth, such as aeronautics and space exploration.\n"
"\n"
"The alien armour uses CNTs as its penetration layer, i.e. the layer that stops bullets and other incoming ordnance from penetrating into the body. The nanotubes are woven into long latticework patterns and recessed into a bed of hard polymer, backed by a layer of semi-liquid gel that very effectively dampens the energy of a blow and spreads the remaining force across a very large area. The final layer -- woven from flexible aramid fibre -- serves to contain the gel and doubles as a spall liner, catching any fragments that may be blown loose from the inside of the armour.\n"
"\n"
"Thanks to the conductive properties of carbon nanotubes, the armour performs very well against plasma as well as against ordinary bullets, lasers and explosives. However ironically, it's not very effective against incendiary devices or flamethrowers, since these weapons also raise the atmospheric temperature around the wearer. In this scenario the armour is left with no place to effectively dump its heat and will not protect the wearer as he roasts inside his suit.\n"
"\n"
"Other features of the armour include servo-assisted movement in the boots, allowing the wearer to move more quickly, and a curious system built into the bracers that automatically assists the wearer's aim by selectively applying pressure to parts of the forearm. We are looking into many new uses for this technology.\n"
"\n"
"Adapting this armour to a human body would be impossible due to the differences in physique and the difficulty of working with the materials involved. However, I've written up a separate research proposal to investigate the possibility of designing and mass-producing our own armour using the alien suit as a template. It will be in your inbox presently, Commander.\n"

"Commander, we've recovered a suit of alien body armour from the battlefield. This armour has been a plague to our soldiers due to its very high resistance to various types of damage; aliens wearing it have shrugged off shots that would have torn their unarmoured friends apart. It's not surprising that we still haven't managed to cut it open to perform an initial survey of its composition. We should investigate the armour's weaknesses as soon as we can, and perhaps ascertain a way to adapt it for our own uses.\n"

"Where armour is concerned, the aliens' design philosophy seems to be, \"If it works, let's use more of it.\" This new armour is similar in design to the alien body armour, but it does away with the compromises and delicate balances of light armour. Instead of just protecting the torso and head, the medium armour attempts to cover all vital areas with much more dense nanopolymer plates, including major arteries and sensitive nerve clusters. In comparison with the alien body armour, the medium suit has double the number of nanotube strands per square centimetre. As a result these plates are nearly impenetrable to standard human firearms and even the softer mesh covering the joints can stop bullets with disturbing ease.\n"
"\n"
"As I mentioned before, the suit strongly emphasises protection over mobility. The large trauma plates get in the wearer's way no matter what race or size he might be, and the dense nanotube polymers used are so heavy that the overall weight will slow down even an Ortnok. There are numerous mini-servos and other mechanical parts that help deal with some of the weight, but their effect is limited overall. Other devices are integrated into the armour to assist aiming and vision. These are quite interesting and we may be able to replicate them on a larger scale as weapon enhancements.\n"
"\n"
"The aliens seem to have designed this armour with the war against humanity in mind. Besides being virtually bulletproof, its performance against lasers, incendiary and plasma weapons is much improved over the Alien Body Armour, though it's still somewhat vulnerable to particle beams. Aliens wearing this armour will suffer minimal damage from crossing open flame or brief shots from our flamethrower, but prolonged exposure will still overheat the suit and cook the alien inside.\n"
"\n"
"In better news, the armour does not fully enclose the alien, leaving some skin or breathing passages exposed to air. That means blister gas will remain effective, though it will take longer for the gas to reach its full effect.\n"
"\n"
"The alien suits won't fit our troops without modifications that would critically weaken them. We've taken a few stabs at replicating the dense nanopolymers, but our Workshop machinery is currently unable to weave so many nanotubes at once. I have a few ideas about how to upgrade it, though, as well as some designs for a new armour to take advantage of those upgrades. The proposal should be in your queue now, Commander.\n"

"We concluded early on in our survey that this astrogation unit is, at its core, a purpose-built computer of extraordinary power loaded with specialised software -- all intended solely for the purpose of plotting a course from one point in space to another. It uses a new, alien system of astronomical notation which we've decided to adopt in order to make use of this alien hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Now that we've figured out its notation system, we can see that the astrogation unit is very good at what it does. Given correct input, the system can plot a course from anywhere to anywhere in seconds, and it can intelligently recompute that course with filters like 'least travel time', 'shortest distance', 'fewest navigational hazards', and so on. These filters can be layered on endlessly until the system spits out the exact course you want. It is even able to take into account faster-than-light capability when plotting a course, which all but verifies the theory that the aliens do indeed have access to some type of FTL technology.\n"
"\n"
"The only problem with the unit's plotting method is that it requires a star chart to give accurate courses beyond the UFO's sensor range. We have never found a star chart loaded onto any UFO we've recovered. Perhaps only UFOs with an FTL drive have a chart loaded; they would surely need it for navigation.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of the elusive star chart, the astrogation units we've recovered so far contain enormous detail on Earth and the solar system. Surface maps of the outer planets and all their moons (even a previously-undiscovered moon of Pluto), spectrum analyses of every body in the asteroid belt as well as the distant Kuiper belt, and the orbits of every body in the solar system plotted out hundreds of years in advance. We're not sure if this information will be of any use to us, but it will greatly enhance humanity's body of knowledge about our home system -- whenever we're allowed to release it into the public.\n"
"\n"
"It's possible to program our own star charts into the astrogation unit, but I can only imagine how primitive and incomplete our charts might be compared to what the aliens have. I wouldn't condone any interstellar travel with these units until we can capture an alien chart. However, in the meantime we could certainly use these units to navigate around the solar system if we could design a PHALANX craft capable of launching into space. They will greatly simplify the whole process of interplanetary travel to the point where we'd be able to launch missions to Saturn or even Pluto at the click of a button.\n"
"\n"
"And that is something we should do as soon as humanly possible.\n"

"Commander, I'm happy to report the success of our alien propulsion program. We've cracked the mysteries of the alien engine set-up and we finally understand the path of the antimatter from fuel tank to reaction chamber.\n"
"\n"
"Quoting from my previous report:\n"
"\n"
"(UFO Theory) \"The alien propulsion system is a type of rocket engine unlike any ever built on Earth. It uses direct matter-antimatter annihilation to generate thrust by injecting protons and antiprotons into the reaction chamber, and then channeling this explosive force out the back of the engine. This gives a UFO extreme power and needs no air or other gases to fuel the reaction, allowing it to burn in hard vacuum. There is a highly-advanced cooling system continuously pumping liquid nitrogen through the engine housing in order to keep it cool and reduce the infrared signature. Engine heat is also used to supply the craft's electricity.\"\n"
"\n"
"With this project we've learned a lot about how these engines are constructed, how to control them, and how we might retrofit them to our current airfleet. We should now be able to replicate these engines and use them for any applications we might come up. I have to warn you, though; they will be extremely expensive to produce. Between the complex use of alien materials, the sensitive electromagnetics and the liquid nitrogen cooling system, this really stretches the limits of our production capacity.\n"
"\n"
"Some more research may be required to figure out antimatter storage and control, but the engine upgrades are self-contained units -- basically just an alien engine with adapters on it for human tech. We should be able to start retrofitting as soon as we acquire enough fuel to keep our airfleet in the sky.\n"
"\n"
"I've mentioned before, the power disparity between our liquid fuel and these matter-antimatter engines is nothing short of astonishing. When we start using these engines on our planes, our pilots are going to need some serious re-education about the capabilities of their craft. Let me explain.\n"
"\n"
"In a regular military jet, giving her a little too much throttle around a tight corner can result in impaired judgment and unconsciousness from the force of acceleration. Pilots have died from over-acceleration.\n"
"\n"
"In an antimatter jet, however, these problems are amplified hundred-fold. The engines are so powerful that over-acceleration can easily turn a human body to bloody pulp in its flight chair. Even the craft itself may have trouble coping with the acceleration, and our flight engineers will have to be extremely careful in checking for metal fatigue, hairline fractures and other wear and tear on the airframe. A tiny crack in the structure may result in one of our planes breaking up in mid-flight. Mechanical thrust limiters can only do so much -- most of the G-stresses are incurred during turns.\n"
"\n"
"Still, it shouldn't become a problem as long as everyone -- pilots and mechanics alike -- is extremely careful in their assigned tasks. We've done some serious tightening-up of our safety and inspection protocol just for antimatter planes. The retraining of our pilots is the only remaining obstacle to our use of these alien engines.\n"

"Commander, the alien sensor suite appears to be a very powerful set of passive and active scanning systems, including radar, lidar, magnetic and UV/infrared reception, and -- most interestingly -- a kind of detection unknown to us, but which seems to have far more success at detecting UFOs than anything we have.\n"
"\n"
"If you'll let us take the suite apart, I believe we can find out what everything does and how to operate it, and how to replicate most if not all of the alien detection equipment. It would be an immense boost to our defence efforts on Earth if we can get this technology working for us, and its long-term potential for spacecraft development is vital. There's no way we could build a viable space-capable fighter with human sensors.\n"

"The project on alien detection is complete, Commander. We now have a full understanding of the machinery, its controls, and the modifications needed for human use.\n"
"\n"
"Our initial assessment looks to have been correct. The detection suite makes use mostly of standard, reliable detection methods that humanity either uses or knows about. The equipment is more advanced than ours and will be useful, but by and large the aliens apply the same concepts and use the same physics as we do. As I mentioned in my proposal, radar, lidar and other such old reliables are all well-represented in the suite.\n"
"\n"
"And then there's the mystery sensor.\n"
"\n"
"It had us confounded for a long time, because now that it's here on the Earth's surface, it spits out mostly overpowering background noise. Up in the air, however, the picture is quite different. We think we've now identified the detector and have figured out how it works.\n"
"\n"
"In the simplest terms, it's a gravity sensor, scanning for minute changes in a background gravitational field. Everything travelling through a gravity field disturbs the field to some degree based on its size, mass and composition. The sensor can identify these changes as natural or artificial objects based on course, speed and acceleration with 95% accuracy. If there is any doubt about a contact, the system will report it anyway. It seems to be more effective in stronger fields like the one around Earth, but we surmise that it will work to some extent anywhere within the gravity range of a star.\n"
"\n"
"All of this detection power is linked into an advanced computer system which automatically puts all results through a series of filters, which can be adjusted at any time to suit the needs of the pilot and crew. This helps alternately sifting out targets from a mess of background noise or increasing sensitivity to search for something stealthy.\n"
"\n"
"Interestingly, the detection computer seems to have a direct link to fire control, assisting in anticipating target manoeuvres and point defence control if the craft has that capability.\n"
"\n"
"Parts of this technology can be adapted to our existing ground-based installations and aircraft radar. It should extend their detection range and increase resolution across the board, making it a good deal harder for UFOs to hide. However, the biggest practical gains will come from using this tech in creating new aircraft instrumentation to increase the combat survivability of our interceptors.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, it's not the immediate uses that are the most important. These detectors are vital for any future PHALANX spacecraft. In space, without the support of ground radar, we're going to need the extra power very badly.\n"

"The XVI census program has just gone into effect. Weekly rolling tests have commenced this morning, and I've got a full report on our estimated performance levels and operational details.\n"
"\n"
"Our strategy is based around local medical centres, where the XVI tests are performed by existing nursing staff under the supervision of a small police or military guard. If a test turns out positive, this guard will perform the arrest and turn the infected prisoners over to the UN for containment and study. Once the aliens figure out this scheme -- I don't think it'll take them long -- the infected people will start avoiding the census, thereby giving us the data we need simply by their absence.\n"
"\n"
"As always there's good news and bad news. I'll start with the bad news.\n"
"\n"
"Despite our best efforts, the census data will have some limitations. 99.9% of the planet's population is registered with one national authority or another, but out of ten billion people that still leaves several million unaccounted for. We will be able to extrapolate figures that are accurate to within several thousand heads, but the statistics we generate won't ever be exact. This means the program is less useful for identifying those who have been infected, but still a godsend for keeping track of XVI spread and alien activity on a global basis. After all, we need to know what kind of progress we're making against this new threat.\n"
"\n"
"The good news is that the UN and the member nations have agreed to shoulder the entire cost of the census program. They are handling all the equipment and manpower locally, with strenuous checks as to the reliability of personnel and the validity of the results. The information will be piped directly to our command centre at no charge to us.\n"
"\n"
"The best thing about this program is that we can now keep track of infection levels and how much threat each region is under from XVI. This will work in conjunction with our normal detection methods to warn us where alien activity is worst and allow us to intervene before the situation becomes critical.\n"
"\n"
"Any area where XVI seems to be gaining ground should be posted with additional air patrols, and we should be on the lookout for any attempts by the aliens to solidify their hold on the ground. Alien activity reports in this area should be investigated and responded to with extreme prejudice.\n"

"\n"
"What I propose to do is to create a long-term rolling census that checks all registered individuals on the entire planet for XVI infection by way of a small blood test. Everyone will be required to submit to this test once a week to make sure they're clean -- more frequently if they fall under suspicion of infection. Samples will only need to be as large as a single drop of blood, taken from a random vein to prevent tampering. Fortunately the XVI organism is large and prevalent enough that we can test these samples on the spot with near-100%-confidence results.\n"
