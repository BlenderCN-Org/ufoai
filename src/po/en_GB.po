msgstr "The aliens' homeworld is a small planet orbiting the star Antares. They have evolved in a similar fashion as humans, developing from single-celled life-forms into organisms, then into amphibians, then mammals, and eventually developing the opposing thumb. Today, their technology has entered the fusion age, where the power of stars is harnessed in devices small enough to carry around. They have also discovered a form of faster-than-light travel, though an interstellar trip still takes years, and the crew must be put in stasis for the duration. In terms of technological advances therefore, the Antareans are a few hundred years ahead; in terms of society, however, they are several hundred years behind. Their society resembles the feudal system during Earth's middle ages. The Antarean King is the highest authority, and all defer to his will. The Antareans are a warlike species. They have already conquered several other worlds, enslaving their indigenous populations and, in the case of the Ortnoks, compelling them to fight for their cause. Now, the Antarean warlords have set their sights on Earth. But unlike the inhabitants of their previous targets, humans turned out to be an intellectual match for the Antareans. Earth may well prove to be a tougher nut to crack than the Antarean warlords had originally thought..."

Additionally the Ortnoks have several cybernetic implants which involve mainly the cardiovascular system, the muscles, the eyes and the brain. They enhance the physical strenght and stamnia as well as the senses to a level superior to any human. The purpose of the brain implants is mostly unclear but it is believed that they serve as receivers for commands.
