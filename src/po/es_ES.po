Although a mobile variant called Mobile Tactical High-Energy Laser (MTHEL) already exists, such systems are too large and inefficient to have any real advantages over conventional weapons. The basic design of these weapons involves a chemical laser (in this case, a deuterium fluoride laser), which our scientists found out how to make significantly more efficient and compact. This may lead to new lightweight MTHEL weapons in the near future. "

Apparently the tachyons are given a defined spin inside the accelerator so they are able to interact with any material. They still tend to infiltrate easily through any known armor and lose their particle energy not before a penetrating distance of about 10 cm. Therefore a soldier hit by a tachyon charge suffers only minor superficial injury but is heavily wounded in his viscera. These properties of tachyon particles have been used to create devastating weapons that the aliens now use to terrorize humanity.

In particular, the recently analyzed charged plasma beams are reported to dissipate on the surface of the nano-material, consuming some of the fullerene fabric, but not passing through. Not only that, but the nano-fabric is promising to also be lighter than similar conventional materials."

"El ataque alienígena a Mumbai hizo nuestra situación dolorosamente clara. Su tecnología es mucho más avanzada que la nuestra. La completa falta de avance de las tropas de la Commonwealth en la ofensiva de Mumbai reveló debilidades críticas en el equipamiento y entrenamiento militar actual. Se perdieron tres batallones en el campo de tiro sin inflingir bajas significativas en el enemigo. PHALANX debe superar estos problemas, y para ello necesitamos la mejor tecnología que la humanidad pueda proporcionar.\n"
"\n"
"El Programa Excalibur fue creado para encontrar las armas mas efectivas de la Tierra revisando sus procedimientos de desarrollo, durabilidad, registro operacional y eficiacia de combate en aquellas situaciones en las que hemos conseguido presentar batalla a los alienigenas.\n"
"\n"
"El rifle francés LeBlanc FAA-191 (Fusil Assaut Automatique) proporciona la combinación mas equilibrada en cuanto alcance, penetración de blindajes y tamaño de cargador de todos los rifles de asalto analizados. Es un diseño de arma corta, asi que el cargador y gatillo se encuentran debajo del cañon para reducir la longitud total del arma. El 191 usa cargadores de 30 balas del calibre 4.7mm, que son perforadores de acero con nucleo de tungsteno con una impresionante capacidad de traspasar armaduras a corta y media distancia. Las balas pierden efectividad en el largo alcance, pero en cualquier caso este rifle de asalto no está recomendado para combates a larga distancia.\n"
"\n"
"A pesar de que su diseño es algo antiguo (el primer prototipo data de 2057), ningún otro rifle ha superado al 191. Es preciso y muy rapido de recargar. Su solida construccion hace que sea poco probable su rotura o encasquillamiento durante el combate. Es resistente al calor, al frio, al polvo y a la humedad, y a cualquier combinación de ellas. Su munición y sus piezas de repuesto se encuentran disponibles a lo largo del globo debido a la madurez de su diseño y a la relativa popularidad alcanzada entre las fuerzas armadas de los distintos paises. Este es un rifle al que puedes confiar tu vida.\n"
"\n"
"Para uso interno en PHALANX, hemos clasificado este rifle como AR-80.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Doctrina Recomendada\n"
"\n"
"Esta deberá ser considerara como el arma principal para enfrentamientos de corto y medio alcance ya que proporciona una impresionante capacidad de fuego, y su alcance mortal es mayor que la de cualquier pistola o ametralladora.\n"
"\n"
"Sin embargo nadie debe mantener la ilusión de que el rifle de asalto es la unica pieza de nuestro arsenal. Se requiere una elección equilibrada de armas para superar diferentes situaciones; mientras que el rifle de asalto se comporta bien a poca distancia, puede ser dificil de manejar en pasillos estrechos donde su eficacia se ve superada por ametralladoras y escopetas. Cualquier combate dentro de edificios deberá ser manejado con armas de corto alcance, mientras que los soldados equipados con rifles se ocupan de vigilar el perimetro o de proteger la retaguardia del pelotón de asalto.\n"
"\n"
"Si nuestras tropas equipadas con rifles de asaltos se ven en una situación donde el alcance de sus armas no es efectivo, deberán usar una estrategia de protección mutua mientras se acercan al enemigo, a la vez que los francotiradores protegen su avance desde una posición segura.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"A pesar de que el AR-80 es un buen rifle en todos los aspectos, no fue diseñado para combatir la amenaza alienigena. Debemos esforzarnos en diseñar y producir nuestras propias armas adaptas tan pronto que se presente la posibilidad"

"El cuchillo de combate es una hoja sólida de 26 centímetros de afilado acero, que puede usarse en muchas situaciones en el quehacer diario. Como arma, el filo ha sido dopado con componentes cerámicos lo que proporciona una gran capacidad de atravesar armaduras, además de haber sido equilibrado para un correcto lanzamiento. Cuenta también con un anillo de sujección para colocarlo a modo de bayoneta en los cañones las armas que lo permitan.\n"
"\n"
"La inclusion del cuchillo de combate como elemento de nuestro arsenal es un hecho largamente debatido. La batalla de Mumbai nos mostró que incluso en la condición más favorable, un cuchillo no es rival contra las armas alienígenas. Incluso si un soldado armado con un cuchillo consigue llegar a su objetivo sin ser alcanzado, se verá en apuros contra las hojas alienígenas capaces de cortar el más duro de nuestros blindajes. Realmente sólo se contemplan una serie de situaciones muy improbables en las que es posible obtener ventajas de la lucha con cuchillo\n"
"\n"
"En cualquier caso, el cuchillo de combate ha salvado muchas vidas a lo largo de los años cuando las armas de fuego dejan de funcionar o agotan su munición (prueba de ello es que hasta los alienígens usan armas afiladas para el combate cuerpo a cuerpo). Aunque sea un tópico, cuando todo lo demas falla, siempre es mejor combatir con un cuchillo en la mano que con los puños.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Doctrina Recomendada\n"
"\n"
"En combate, el cuchillo debe ser usado como último recurso. Si todas las demás armas estan descargadas y el enemigo se encuentra cerca, un buen cuchillo puede hacer que se termine la lucha con una victoria. Sin embargo, incluso en esa desesperada situacion es una opción peligrosa: usar un cuchillo contra un enemigo que no ha sido previamente herido es un buen modo de acabar en el depósito decadaveres.\n"

"De nuestra experiencia en Mumbai y en otras ciudades atacadas, hemos llegado a la conclusion de que los alienígenas parecen concentrar sus esfuerzos en centros muy poblados, especialmente en las areas urbanas más densas. Una gran parte de los combates se realizan en el corto alcance, incluso en el mano a mano. Como resultado del Programa Excalibur se han elegido varias armas muy eficientes para la categoria de Combate de Corto Alcance.\n"
"\n"
"El lanzallamas iraní ADA 22 (conocido como 'El fuego de Dios' por las tropas aliadas) es una maravilla de la ingenieria moderna. Al contrario que los antiguos lanzallamas del siglo XX, no necesita el combustible tanques de alta presion a la espalda del soldado. El ADA es una unidad de mano sin nungun tubo o manguera. Sólamente alberga un cartucho de gas relativamente pequeño de 200mm en el cañón, que es expulsado despues del disparo para permitir la recarga. El sistema es ingenioso y muy seguro.\n"
"\n"
"El corazon del arma es una potente bomba que concentra el gas en el aire y lleva la mezcla a traves de cuatro quemadores paralelos, uno principal y tres de reserva, capaces de producir hasta diez chipas por segundo cada uno para asegurar la ignición del gas antes de su expulsión. Los quemadores de reserva son muy importantes al prevenir cualquier explosion, debido al combustible que usa el ADA (una sustancia llamada Compuesto 90)\n"
"\n"
"El Compuesto 90 es un nuevo combustible para lanzallamas que, cuando se inyecta en el aire, crea una reaccion termobárica lenta -- una ignición de la mezcla gas-aire en vez de una explosión -- que carbonizar tejido vivo en segundos. El C90 inflige graves daños en objetivos organicos; el calor que genera supera los 1700 ºC, suficiente para derretir titanio. Por otra parte, debido a su naturaleza gaseosa no se deja residuos ni combustilbe en el objetivo o en su entorno, ademas de que el calor se dispersa mucho más rapidamente. Esto lo hace mucho más seguro para uso urbano que sus alternativas basadas en napalm.\n"
"\n"
"El principal inconveniente del ADA 22 es su corto alcance y su complejidad interna, que lo hacen dificil de reparar. En cualquier caso, nuestros tecnicos no deben tener problemas con el mantenimiento de este modelo.\n"
"\n"
"Para uso interno en PHALANX, hemos denominado este lanzallamas como CRC-FL\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Doctrina Recomendada\n"
"\n"
"El CRC-FL es un arma de corto alcance; el usuario necesita ser rápido para situarse cerca del enemigo y descargar tanto calor como sea posible. Es un arma pesada a pesar de su diseño relativamente fino, asi que la fuerza tambien será una caracteristica necesaria para que el soldado pueda sacar todo el potencial al arma.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

"La granada aturdidora es un arma no letal que produce un flash cegador y una onda expansiva que confunde y desorienta temporalmente a los que se encuentran en su area de efecto. El cuerpo de la granada no explota o se fragmenta; y de hecho permanece intacto, lo que permite a nuestros tecnicos recargarlas para su posterior reutilización.\n"
"\n"
"Los humanos afectados por esta granada sufren sordera temporal y perdida del equilibrio, asi como una completa perdida de vision de hasta cinco segundos, pasados los cuales el efecto se desvanece. Esto hace de la granada aturdidora una arma excelente para distraer y desarmar temporalmente al enemigo, especialmente cuando se procede al ataque de posiciones muy bien defendidas. De los informes de combate hemos concluido que la granada aturdidora tiene básicamente el mismo efecto en los alienígenas que en los humanos; los objetivos extraterrestres se muestran efectivamente ciegos y sordos por un corto periodo de tiempo, haciendolos vulnerables. No podemos decir cómo de largo es este periodo, y sin duda alguna variará de alienígena en alienígena, pero aun así puede establecer la diferencia definitiva en un combate.\n"
"\n"
"Además de ser de utilidad en el combate táctico, la granada aturdidora permite a nuestros soldados acercarse a los alienígenas para poder usar otras armas de corto alcance. Esto permite al comandante elegir exactamente el arma adecuada para cada situacion evitando los daños colaterales de una granada de fragmentación. Un enemigo rápido puede paliar los efectos de la granada sencillamente cerrando los ojos y tapandose los oidos, pero esta habilidad necesita entrenamiento especial y en cualquier caso el tiempo de reacción entre el lanzamiento y la explosión es muy limitado. Por lo que sabemos, ningún alienígena ha tenido experiencia previa con este tipo de arma y su efecto parece seguro.\n"
"\n"
"Las ventajas de la granada aturdidora sobrepasan por mucho a sus debilidades. Ha servido en diferentes guerras anteriores a esta, y lo continuará haciendo hasta que su funcionamiento pueda ser reemplazado por un sistema mejor.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Doctrina recomendada\n"
"\n"
"La granada aturdidora no provoca daño físico en su area de efecto, y por esta razon debe ser usada en lugar de otro tipo de granada cuando haya civiles implicados en la situación.\n"
"\n"
"Es un arma indispensable en cualquier terreno que proporciona una covertura considerable. Si un alienígena está atrincherado y el cruzar una esquina puede ser un suicidio, el simple hecho de lanzar una granada aturdidora por el pasillo puede cambiar instantaneamente el resultado del combate en favor de nuestras tropas. Su utilidad no debe ser subestimada.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"

"El concepto de granada de fragmantación ha sufrido pocos cambios desde que fue inventada por los soldados chinos, que introducían polvora prensada en recipientes de metal o cerámica. Los avances en explosivos y en los materiales que forman las grnadas han permitido que su uso sea más rápido y mortal, pero el principio de funcionamiento es el mismo: una sustancia explosiva en el centro de la granada hace que la cubierta (y habitualmente metralla introducida entre la polvora) estalle en fragmentos y salga disparada en todas direcciones, matando o hiriendo a los objetivos en area. La mecha retardante es encendida cuando se retira la anilla y se suelta el seguro, habitualmente cuando la granada se lanza. Suele detonar en pocos segundos.\n"
"\n"
"Para PHALANX hemos seleccionado la granada australiana HG15. Ésta está compuesta de explosivo solido convencional C8, una capa interior de cable enrollado y una capa exterior de acero. Esta diseñada para maximizar el area de efecto lanzando más metralla que cualquier otra granada en el mercado. La cubierta de la HG15 es lisa y sin estrias al contrario que las antiguas granadas \"de piña\", para permitirle rodar en varios tipos de superficie. El explosivo C8 puede ser algo obsoleto, pero es altamente potente y su uso continuado ha demostrado que resiste las condiciones de funcionamiento más adversas.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Doctrina Recomendada\n"
"\n"
"A pesar de ser bastante efectivas contra la infantería enemiga, las granadas de fragmentacion son armas que sólo se deben ser usadas cuando se presenta una oportunidad propicia de aprovechar su potencial, no algo que reemplace a las armas de fuego convencionales. Su alcance está muy limitado y su radio de daños es pequeño. Sin embargo, si la situación precisa de combate en corto alcance o fuego indirecto (a traves de una esquina por ejemplo), la granada de fragmentación puede llevar ala victoria.\n"
"\n"
"Se debe asegurar que no hay aliados o civiles en el area de efecto. En esas situaciones el uso de granadas letales esta desaconsejado a favor de las granadas aturdidoras.\n"

"Se recomienda que cualquier soldado que no carge con armas pesadas se equipe con, al menos, una granada de cualquier tipo (ya sea de fragmentacion, aturdidora, incendiaria o cualquier otro tipo).\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"Incendiary grenades are area-denial weapons, covering a large stretch of ground with very hot flames that are almost impossible to extinguish. Once thrown, the body of the grenade explodes, spreading the incendiary compound over the surrounding area -- and anyone unlucky enough to be inside the area of effect. The compound itself is a modification of a mixture that has been in use since World War II; thermite, barium nitrate, sulphur and binding agent. The grenade's delayed fuse is ignited by first pulling the pin and then releasing the handle, usually released as the grenade is thrown. It will detonate after a period of several seconds.\n"
"\n"
"The standard American M71 grenade consists of a core of C8 explosive, an inner layer of incendiary agent, and an outer plastic casing that provides no fragmentation but more importantly doesn't slow down or otherwise impede the delivery of the payload over a large area. The M71's casing is a smooth cylinder shape, unlike the old 'pineapple' grenades of World War 2, to make it easier to roll across various surfaces.\n"
"\n"
"Like all hand grenades, their range is limited, but they can be an essential tool for achieving control of the battlefield.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Incendiary grenades are tactical weapons that should be used to contain or herd the enemy into disadvantageous ground. They cannot be thrown very far, but they can serve to block off escape routes, to flush out rooms, or simply to catch the enemy in a blazing inferno.\n"
"\n"
"Care should be taken that no friendlies (especially civilians) are caught in the area of effect, as the effect of the thermate cocktail on human tissue is a particular public relations nightmare. In such situations the use of lethal grenades is strongly discouraged; flashbangs should be given preference.\n"
"\n"
"It's recommended that all soldiers carrying non-heavy weapons should be equipped with at least one grenade of some variety -- be it an incendiary grenade, frag grenade, flashbang or other -- in case the need should arise. Two or more are strongly recommended.\n"
"\n"
"\n"

Es el lanzagranadas de infanteria mas usado en todo el mundo debido a su fiabilidad y su poco peso. Tambien cuenta con una impresiontante seleccion de cartuchos compatibles del calibre 25mm.\n"
"\n"
"El RA6 almacena hasta 9 granadas cargadas individualmente en un cilindro giratorio. Recargar las granadas puede ser un proceso agonizantemente lento ya que hay que desarmar el cilindro, pero habitualmente es la mejor forma de hacerlo. Existen cargadores rapidos y son compatibles con el RA6, pero suelen ser voluminosos y dificiles de transportar.\n"
"\n"
"El arma tiene dos modos de fuego: - Explosión ratardada, en el cual la granada detona despues de un tiempo prefijado.- Ataque aereo, en el cual la granada detona en el aire despues de viajar una cierta distancia. La velocidad de fuego máxima para el RA6 es de un disparo por segundo en semi-automatico, o tres disparos a la vez cuando se hace girar el cilindro en modo ráfaga, lo que puede devastar amplias zonas.\n"
"\n"
"La munición estandar para el RA6 es la Granada de Alto Impulso Termobárico (AIT) de 25mm, que usa el oxigeno atmosferico como combustible de la explosion en lugar de cargar con un agente oxidante propio. Las armas termobáricas producen mucha mas fuerza explosiva de la conseguida con explosivos convencionales del mismo tamaño. Su poder de destrucción se basa más en la energía de la explosión y el calor en lugar de en la fragmentación y metralla que caracteriza a los explosivos convencionales.\n"
"\n"
"Esta es una de las armas mas versatiles y efectivas de nuestro arsenal. Aunque no sea tan poderoso como el Lanzacohetes, es un arma fiable ideal para la infantería de artilleria.\n"
"\n"
"Para uso interno en PHALANX, hemos denominado este Lanzagranadas como HPGL.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Doctrina Recomendada\n"
"\n"
"El HPGL es sueño táctico de un comandante hecho realidad. Produce un gran daño con un alcance excelente, puede herir a varios objetivos apiñados con una sola explosion, puede ser usado para tareas especiales como por ejemplo delimitar un area de exclsuión con Granadas Incendiarias... Puede ser tan efectivo en corto alcance como en areas abiertas, sin embargo hay que usarla con precaución.\n"
"\n"
"El ataque aereo se usa preferentemente en terreno abierto; en este caso se sacrifica algo de alcance al eliminar el factor rebote, pero esto tambien tiene sus beneficios. El factor rebote puede perjudicar seriamente la precisión si la granada aterriza en una zona desnivalada y permite al enemigo correr o cubrirse antes de la detonacion. El ataque aereo permite al soldado detonar sus granadas exactamente donde quiere. A no ser que ocurra un fallo catastrofico en el detonador, el ataque aereo es poco dado a errores mecánicos que lo desvien de su objetivo.\n"
"\n"
"En corto alcance las granadas con explosion retardada pueden rebotar en las paredes y alrededor de las esquinas para alcanzar objetivos escondidos o peligrosos. En cualquier caso el soldado debe tener cuidado de no permitir que los rebotes acaben con él o con cualquier aliado dentro del radio de alcance de la explosión. Esto haría que el soldado fuera bastante impopular para el resto del equipo que continuase con vida. Siempre que haya civiles cerca, el uso de granadas con rebote esta desaconsejado debido a la incertidumbre inherente.\n"
"\n"
"Para situaciones de emergencia en corto alcance -- por ejemplo si el soldado no tiene otra arma a mano-- el lanzagranadas puede ser cargado con cartuchos de dardos de 25mm, similares a los cartuchos de escopeta. Aunque tienen menos daño potencial que los de escopeta debido a su menor velocidad de salida, puede salvar al soldado sin poner su vida en peligro como lo haria una granada común.\n"

"Además del rifle de francotirador y los lanzacohetes, este es una de las pocas armas humanas totalmente efectivas contra alienígenas roboticos."

Another advantage of the heavy laser is that it also has much greater accuracy than its more explosive counterpart the RPG-37, as it is able to target specific parts of vehicles and buildings, allowing for a more predictable demolition operation.\n"

"El ataque alienígena a Mumbai hizo nuestra situación dolorosamente clara. Su tecnología es mucho más avanzada que la nuestra. La completa falta de avance de las tropas de la Commonwealth en la ofensiva de Mumbai reveló debilidades críticas en el equipamiento y entrenamiento militar actual. Se perdieron tres batallones en el campo de tiro sin inflingir bajas significativas en el enemigo. PHALANX debe superar estos problemas, y para ello necesitamos la mejor tecnología que la humanidad pueda proporcionar.\n"
"\n"
"El Programa Excalibur fue creado no sólo para encontrar las armas adecuadas para combatir la amenaza alienígena, sino tambien para proporcionar el blindaje y cualquier otro tipo de equipamiento que nuestros soldados necesitasen en el campo de batalla para regresar sanos y salvos de una batalla victoriosa. Este equipamiento ha sido diseñado para incrementar la eficacia del soldado en combate y su capacidad de supervivencia en general.\n"
"\n"
"Las Gafas de Vision Nocturna infrarrojas han sido usadas en los campos de batalla durante generaciones, y la miniaturización ha conseguido que se conviertan en parte del uniforme estandar de un soldado en operaciones nocturnas. Los avances en electrónica durante los últimos 30 años han permitido al equipo de visión infrarroja reducir su tamaño hasta el de unas simples gafas de buceo sin perder eficacia.\n"
"\n"
"Estas gafas captan todas las emisiones infrarrojas en el entorno y las muestran en la parte interna de las lentes. Pueden llevarse comodamente toda la duración de un combate nocturno, extendiendo el alcance visual del soldado en la oscuridad y permitiendole incluso ver enemigos a traves de paredes delgadas. Las paredes más gruesas presentan un gran obstaculo para estas gafas y pueden ocultar al enemigo completamente. Por desgracia no hay forma de distinguir entre las emisiones infrarrojas de un civil de aquellas emitidas por un alienígena si no tenemos linea de visión directa. Cualquier lectura tomada a traves de paredes u otros obstaculos no debe ser considerada como definitiva para el inicio de un ataque.\n"
"\n"
"Las gafas de vision nocturna trabajan incluso de dia, aunque su efectividad se verá muy reducida a pleno sol.\n"
"\n"
"Desgraciadamente esta tecnología tiene sus desventajas. Llevar las gafas puestas limita la visión periférica del soldado y reduce la coordinación mano-ojo, provocando una pequeña merma de punteria. Peor aun, nuestros archivos procedentes del ataque de Mumbai confirman que algunos alienígenas que emiten poco calor corporal pueden escapar por completo a la visión infrarroja. Esto podría permitirles acercarse sigilosamente a nuestro equipo y comenzar un ataque a corto alcance si ninguno de nuestros otros soldados es capaz de verlos.\n"
"\n"
"Conclusión: estas gafas incrementaran nuestra eficacia en situaciones nocturnas, haciendo que estas sean mucho menos peligrosas para nuestras tropas.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Doctrina Recomendada\n"
"\n"
"Debemos usar este equipo de forma esporádica y táctica para evitar costosos errores. Se recomienda que no más de la mitad del equipo las lleve durante un enfrentamiento para no tener sorpresas. Un equipo de dos hombres -- uno equipado con estas gafas y otro sin ellas -- es la mejor combinación en el campo de batalla.\n"
"\n"
"Usar las gafas durante el dia está generalmente contraindicado ya que pierden mucha de su utilidad a pleno sol. La unica razón para continuar su uso en estas situaciones podría ser para tener una referencia termica a traves de paredes delgadas.\n"
"\n"
"Los combatientes con armas de corto alcance sufrirán poco las consecuencias de esta perdida de puntería, pero para los tiradores de largo alcance puede ser fatal, ya que un tiro fallado puede tener consecuencias terribles para todo el grupo. De todas formas los francotiradores tendrán dispositivos apuntadores laser en sus mirillas.\n"

"A vicious alien blade of unusual shape. Nobody knows for sure if it's of ritual significance to the aliens, a training weapon or just the ancient assassin's aid that survived to the modern era due to it's tremendous effectiveness. What is apparent, however, is that aliens are able to silently kill with this blade even most vigilant opponents, be it factory guards or farm dogs. There are also horrifying reports of them using the blade for dissecting living animals or even human beings.\n"
"The blade is composed of an alloy that is so incredibly coherent and smooth that it's almost impossible to dent, scratch or blunt. The only downside to this alloy is its increased weight and enormously high melting point, making it almost impossible to fashion without the aid of massive plasma furnaces.\n"
"The edge of the Kerrblade has been sharpened at the molecular level, enabling the weapon to slice all but the hardest materials with ease. Despite anatomic differences, our soldiers skilled in martial arts find themselves surprisingly comfortable with this weapon, though it's a little too bulky for hand-to-hand combat.\n"
"\n"
"Battle Implications: The Kerrblade is a large and heavy weapon designed for melee combat. It can be thrown short distances, but it's badly balanced, making the damage quite low, as a rule. It does not fit into the holster, so it's not quite a sidearm. It is one-handed and close range, so it's definitely not a primary weapon."

"\n"
"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"In the past, the application of first aid and field surgery in hostile situations required specially-trained combat medics and surgeons who could handle the stresses of saving lives under fire. Troops who saw their friends being hit usually had no choice but to keep fighting and hope the medics would arrive in time -- that is, if they didn't freeze or panic or make some futile attempt at a field dressing without ability or materials. If the wounded survived at all, they'd still be out of action for weeks or months at a time.\n"
"\n"
"This may have been a workable strategy in the trenches of World War 2, but it isn't any longer. Waiting for a medic to arrive on the scene can contribute to the death of a soldier who might have been saved by immediate aid. The prompt application of trauma medicine needs to be made as quick and easy as possible so that any soldier can provide life-saving effort with minimal training. This is where the modern medikit comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Every medikit contains an onboard computer that can diagnose injuries via directed X-ray and ultrasound. It can run ECGs and EEGs at the same time, measure blood pressure and heart rate, and even calculate the soldier's combat effectiveness based on his or her individual record (stored in a small subdermal chip for medical, locational and identification purposes). All this information can be shown in a small hologram or displayed directly to a soldier's helmet information system. At the same time the medikit can deploy a number of drugs and sterile surgical tools for emergency operations, cauterise wounds via a special heating iron, and -- most importantly -- apply its store of nanorobots to a wound.\n"
"\n"
"The old idea of medical nanobots was first put into practice by Vietnamese researchers thirty years ago. Today, medicine without them is almost unthinkable. Nanobots are tiny robots several nanometres in diameter which can be programmed to perform specific tasks on the fly. They will quickly sterilise a wound and seal ruptured arteries, alert the medikit operator about any internal bleeding, request suction at appropriate places, patch up bowel or stomach punctures, revive or remove necrotic tissue, and repair nerve damage. They dissolve harmlessly in the victim's bloodstream once their battery runs out, which lasts no longer than 10 to 15 seconds, often not long enough to stabilise heavily-wounded troops. Two or more doses of nanobots may be required. Any number of doses can be applied and metabolised with no ill effects.\n"
"\n"
"This technology is the most important breakthrough in trauma surgery ever made. It can do everything except regenerate tissue. If more attention is required -- for example when a vital organ is hit, or a bullet is lodged in a critical place -- the medikit provides equipment and detailed instructions for the soldier to follow. It can never replace the operating room, but it's as close to a portable hospital as we'll ever get.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All our soldiers have been trained in the use of the medikit. In fact, in an ideal situation, every soldier would carry one for immediate use -- but I recognise that our troops have a limited carrying capacity. All major wounds should be treated without delay to prevent complications and further risk to the injured soldier. If the victim can still walk, she should retreat from the firefight and seek cover in order to safely receive treatment by a comrade.\n"
"\n"
"The medikit's onboard pharmacy can also be used to revive unconscious soldiers. If this is done, please take care to remove the revived troop from the line of fire as soon as possible and proceed with further treatment from a safe position. The medic herself may be forced to engage approaching targets to enable the patient's escape; this is acceptable practice, but please supply the medic with adequate covering fire. Trading one soldier's life for another does not make for good battlefield mathematics.\n"
"\n"
"Once a wounded soldier makes it back to base alive, our medical team will take over treatment. The risk of anyone succumbing to battlefield trauma while in a PHALANX ward is less than one percent, and as near to zero as we can make it.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"Chief among the new generation of super-pistols is the Dolvich DV762 from Russia. It follows the design philosophy of its home country; rugged, reliable power without frills. Its design is extremely basic, and though the materials used in its construction are far stronger to cope with the new powder, the DV762's internals are no more advanced than any pistol of the late 20th century.\n"
"\n"
"The DV762 does not compromise. It isn't a multi-function firearm. It's designed for only one thing: to punch through armour and kill the person inside. In order to do this, the DV fires the ancient 7.62mm Tokarev pistol round, either on semi-automatic or three-round burst mode, from a 12-round detachable box magazine. The Tokarev round is known for its excellent penetration, and it has been significantly upgraded on its return to military service. This pistol can shoot clean through the side of a modern ballistic helmet at ranges of up to 10 metres -- and then out the other side.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, in order to achieve penetration, the DV sacrifices stopping power. The 7.62mm round makes a very clean hole in the enemy, which is the problem; it's very reluctant to fragment or tumble, requiring a direct hit on a vital organ or major artery to incapacitate or kill an enemy.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of the Excalibur program, we concluded that a guaranteed minor hit is better than one that may simply bounce off an alien's armour, especially as we have yet to gain a clear picture of how nasty alien armour can get. We need sidearms that we know will be effective in the crunch, and the DV762 is the best of them.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this pistol the classification P-12.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The P-12 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at such ranges or has run out of ammo.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may even consider using two pistols at the same time, though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single P-12 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who do not have room for larger weapons.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Despite good penetration against organics, this weapon performs very poorly against robotic targets."

"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"With the return of armour to the battlefield, starting with steel helmets in World War 1 and fragmentation vests in Vietnam, pistols have had a harder and harder time keeping up. Due to their far lower muzzle velocity compared to longer-barreled and/or fully automatic weapons, they've had increasing trouble penetrating the new, ever-higher standards of human armour -- much less advanced alien composites. The very concept of the pistol in military use came under fire at one point in the 21st century, and was saved only by the advent of super-high-velocity powder.\n"
"\n"
"The major drawback of super-high-velocity powder is that it cannot be used in fully-automatic weapons, since no firearms action on this Earth can survive that much violence for long without breaking. The British APMP pistol ignores these concerns by using more ordinary smokeless powder and a longer, almost SMG-length barrel to achieve higher velocities and greater kinetic power. It is a true machine pistol, fully automatic and capable of firing 600 rounds per minute from its surprisingly slim-lined 30-round detachable box magazine. It has no semi-automatic capability, only full-auto and 3-round burst fire.\n"
"\n"
"The APMP fires the specially-developed 4.2x24mm round that goes through kevlar like it wasn't there. Once inside a human body this tiny round tumbles like a madman and creates huge wound cavities. It has a deal of trouble penetrating modern body armour, but this is offset by the APMP's ability to deliver repeated hits from its large magazine, all in a pistol-sized package. Unfortunately, the APMP can be a little unwieldy due to its size. Accuracy during burst and fully-automatic fire suffers as a result.\n"
"\n"
"Whenever we need an automatic weapon no larger than our own P-12, this is the weapon that fills the gap.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this machine pistol the classification MP-699.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The MP-699 is primarily a backup weapon. It is a significant step up from the combat knife as a weapon of last resort, and it lets a soldier respond to new close-range threats if the primary weapon is rendered ineffective at such ranges or has run out of ammo. It is a good alternative for soldiers who have trouble hitting anything with the P-12, but the MP-699 is low-powered in comparison with the P-12. Furthermore, its magazines are large enough to preclude hanging them from a soldier's belt and far fewer of them can be carried conveniently.\n"
"\n"
"Ambidextrous soldiers may consider using two pistols at the same time, though this will negatively impact accuracy and reduce the soldier's already minimal effective range.\n"
"\n"
"A single MP-699 should rarely be considered as a primary weapon, as it is outclassed in this role by nearly every other weapon in our arsenal. Its advantages are the advantages of a sidearm -- small size and weight. Still, it may find a use as a primary weapon with field medics and technicians who do not have room for larger weapons.\n"

"Using the same technology as the Plasma Rifle but in a much smaller scale, the Plasma Atomizer can also do considerable damage to its target. The overheated xenon plasma is contained inside a strong magnetic field implemented in the weapon's clip and fired continuously in minimal portions, either encased in polimer membranes or loose. In the latter case, the plasma particles that travel first, ionize the air and disperse, but the rest of the particles travels far and fast. Because of the smaller dimensions of this sidearm, the magnetic field generators are not that capable as the ones used in the Plasma Rifle. Therefore the kinetic energy given to the plasma beam is lessened, but due to longer bursts recoil is not.\n"

"\n"
"The South-African MPMDS (Multi-Purpose Missile Delivery System) has a classic, almost surgically clean name that completely belies its purpose. It is the heaviest infantry missile launcher on the market, able to fire anti-tank shells as easily as high-explosive rockets that turn infantry into hamburger. Originally intended as light field artillery, this weapon is fairly new; its only combat experience has been in Mumbai in the hands of Commonwealth troops. It was one of the handful of weapons that eventually turned the tide in the fighting -- and there is a good reason why.\n"
"\n"
"Alien UFOs on the ground emit fantastic amounts of jamming and other EW (Electronic Warfare) activity. In fact, they emit so much of it that ordinary 'smart' missiles are rendered completely ineffective. If one type of alien EW doesn't fool the missile's relatively stupid electronic brain, another will. No amount of tinkering by Earth's military engineers has been able to fix the situation. The MPMDS, however, will remain effective against the alien invaders -- one of the few human missile launchers that can -- because its rockets carry no onboard guidance.\n"
"\n"
"The rockets are 120mm monsters the size of artillery shells. They are fired out of a smoothbore barrel, fin-stabilised in flight, and have a maximum effective range of 70 metres. Surprisingly they are made up of only three parts: a rocket booster, a warhead and an impact trigger. This simplicity allows them to remain effective and reliable in the most hazardous situations. Though the rockets are not very accurate, they will devastate anything in their path, even aliens. It takes only one good hit from an MPMDS rocket to send the enemy flying.\n"
"\n"
"Standard ammunition for this launcher includes: HE (High-Explosive) rockets, AA (Anti-Armour) rockets, and IC (Incendiary) rockets. New types of MPMDS ammo were being researched by Commonwealth manufacturers before the start of the war. We have all their data on file and could use it to create revolutionary new rocket types.\n"
"\n"
"Along with the HPGL Grenade Launcher, this weapon will provide our troops the artillery support they need to survive and win through.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rocket launcher the classification HPML.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The HPML is best used in a support role, providing covering fire for our assault troops with high-explosive and/or incendiary rockets. However, care should be taken that friendly fire incidents do not occur, as this could have disastrous effects in a combat mission.\n"
"\n"
"Friendly troops should be kept away from the rear of the launcher during firing; the hot exhaust gases are extremely dangerous to nearby humans. The HPML should not be fired at targets closer than 8 metres from the shooter. Violating these safety guidelines could result in serious injury or death to the shooter and other members of the team. If a target is closer than 8 metres, any shooter should immediately resort to his sidearm or a combat knife. Anything else would be suicide.\n"

"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Many great shotguns have come out of Italy over the past two centuries; the latest is the Rossi AAA, a semi-automatic combat shotgun developed for use by SWAT and anti-terrorist units. It features several ground-breaking technologies, but its most impressive feature is without a doubt the specially-developed 'Twist' barrel. The Twist is a new type of shotgun barrel that, with a sharp twist of the front handguard, can protrude or flatten the rifling inside the barrel. With this mechanism, the AAA can change its barrel from smoothbore to rifled and back in a tenth of a second. The barrel even adjusts its own diameter and choke to fit whatever type of shell is in the chamber. These two innovations allow the AAA to fire any kind of shotgun ammo at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"The most commonly used military and SWAT ammunition is the 12mm centerfire flechette shell. Each shell contains 8 tiny flechettes -- solid steel needles with fins to stabilise their flight. This ammunition has superior accuracy compared to buckshot and performs excellently against armour. The flechettes are also prone to tumble after penetration, resulting in impressive wounding capability for such a small projectile. Their drawbacks are vulnerability to wind conditions and other deflecting factors. Other types of ammo are available to deal with these situations, however -- and the AAA can fire them all.\n"
"\n"
"In conclusion, the Rossi AAA is a highly versatile shotgun that is among the most effective close-range weapons available. It has a longer range than the CRC-FL Flamethrower and causes more damage than the CRC-8 SMG, providing a good compromise between speed, range and stopping power.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-212.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-212 performs very well at close quarters but quickly loses power as the range increases. Flechette shot tends to spread too far to be effective at range (though less so than ordinary buckshot), while rifled slugs suffer a pronounced projectile drop and are highly susceptible to wind conditions. Though the shotgun can shoot out to medium range, don't expect it to be very effective.\n"
"\n"
"Where this weapon will truly shine is in urban situations where the enemy has little cover to hide behind and can be engaged at close range. However, it can be too long to manoeuvre properly in tight spaces. The CRC-M9 Micro Shotgun may be preferable in these situations.\n"

"The 425 Blesk is a miniature shotgun hailing from the Czech Republic, a favourite of anti-terrorist and military reconnaissance units around the world. It is highly prized for its small frame, manoeuvrability, lightweight construction and reliable operation in combat. It is a significant competitor with the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun for the hearts and minds of shotgun-wielding soldiers.\n"
"\n"
"The Blesk sacrifices versatility and range for raw speed. It is a 12mm semi-automatic, able to shoot as fast as the operator can pull the trigger; there is no other shotgun in existence that responds as fast or as easily to new threats as the Blesk. In its standard configuration, the weapon features a folding foregrip in lieu of a buttstock in order to help the operator deal with the recoil of repeated firings.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the short barrel cuts badly into effective range, making it accurate only out to 10-20 metres, but this is usually enough for the tight urban situations in which PHALANX will be operating most often. It is also more than enough for a sidearm; the Blesk will fit into a sidearm holster with minor modifications and can be set to deploy the foregrip as the weapon is drawn, allowing immediate accurate fire as needed.\n"
"\n"
"The weapon chambered for the common 12mm shotgun calibre. It can fit 7 slugs in a handy pistol-style magazine contained in the grip, which makes it much faster to reload than the CRC-212 Riot Shotgun. However, it requires short shells that can fit into the grip magazine, such as our flechette shells. It cannot fit the full-length saboted slugs.\n"
"\n"
"There are only a handful of weapons that can compete with the Blesk for sheer short-range devastation. Its speed combined with flechette ammo makes for a deadly mix that can be relied upon to quickly dispatch any enemy stupid enough to get into range.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this shotgun the classification CRC-M9.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"All the restrictions that plague shotguns are magnified in the M9: short range, low ammo capacity, high recoil. This makes its function very clear. It is meant only for close-range firefights, where shotguns and sidearms shine. However, M9 operators should keep a close eye on their ammo level so that they don't run out in a tight spot.\n"
"\n"
"While not technically designed as a sidearm, the M9 performs well as one despite its relative bulk. It does more damage than the P-12 Pistol and is more accurate than the CRC-8 SMG. It is a good choice for snipers in particular.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The alien attack on Mumbai made our situation painfully clear. Their technology is far more advanced than ours. The complete inability of Commonwealth troops to make a dent in the Mumbai offensive revealed critical weaknesses in current military training and equipment. They lost three battalions just bringing the aliens to a standstill without inflicting significant casualties. PHALANX has to overcome these odds, and to do that we need the very best human technology has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"The Excalibur Program was created to find the most effective weapons on Earth by reviewing their manufacturing standards, durability, operational record, and their combat performance in the situations where we've managed to bring the aliens to battle.\n"
"\n"
"From our experiences in Mumbai and other stricken cities, we've concluded that the aliens seem to concentrate their efforts on population centres, especially dense urban areas. A majority of engagements have taken place at knife-fighting range. For the purposes of the Excalibur Program, we've chosen several high-performance weapons for our Close Range Combat package.\n"
"\n"
"Designed and manufactured in mainland China, the Ohm 55 SMG is one of the most frightening weapons to come out of the Second Cold War. It was first prototyped in 2035 by scientists working for the Communist Chinese government. Production models were only trickling into government units by the end of the war, but the rebel and Commonwealth troops quickly learned to respect the Ohm's ferocity.\n"
"\n"
"Its rate of fire at full auto exceeds 1200 rounds per minute. It can chew through a 50-round magazine in three seconds. It fires an upgraded version of the Belgian 5.7mm armour-piercing round, a steel penetrator with aluminium core, which can tear kevlar like paper and tumbles brutally through flesh and bone. Even modern ballistic fibre cannot stop this round at anything closer than 12 metres. The Ohm 55 has dominated the field of SMGs for the past 50 years and will continue to do so for at least the next decade.\n"
"\n"
"The Ohm is highly manoeuvrable with a short barrel and sleek lines, but can suffer from excessive muzzle climb on full auto due to the sheer weight of lead the weapon puts out. Autofire also tends to empty the magazine before the shooter even realises he's holding down the trigger. Still, after nearly 50 years in service around the world, this remains the Ohm 55's only known design flaw.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this submachine gun the classification CRC-8.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The CRC-8 is intended for point-blank urban firefights. It will perform very well in this role, but don't expect it to hit the broad side of a barn out to medium range. It can also function as a high-powered sidearm, but may be too bulky for most soldiers to use in this manner.\n"
"\n"
"While the CRC-8 does suffer excessive muzzle climb on full auto, throwing off the aim of even experienced users, it is much more docile in its standard burst mode. Full auto should rarely be considered outside of panic situations.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Despite good penetration against organics, this weapon performs very poorly against robotic targets."

"The 'Artificial Fog' smoke grenade was developed by the African league of nations during the war on the diamond cartels. It is an ingenious design which proves that, even in the age of electronic perception, the smoke grenade hasn't outlived its usefulness. There is no vision system that cannot be defeated somehow, and upgraded smoke grenades like the Artificial Fog grenade can block infrared sighting equipment as easily as they block the Mk. 1 Eyeball.\n"
"\n"
"The Artificial Fog grenade is what is called a 'bursting' smoke grenade. Instead of pouring smoke out of holes in the top, it bursts apart much like an incendiary grenade and covers a large area of ground with titanium tetrachloride, which quickly produces vast clouds of corrosive white smoke. It also fills the air with minuscule 'chaff', flakes of iron that refract radar waves and generally muck up the electronic picture of the battlefield. Other trace additives to the smoke help refract most of the non-visible EM spectrum. Even alien technology has trouble sifting through the thick soup.\n"
"\n"
"Titanium tetrachloride smoke by itself is slightly harmful to human beings due to its acidity. The additives make it more dangerous, especially breathing iron flakes, but it's nothing our medics can't deal with.\n"

"\n"
"Originally an anti-materiel rifle, the Canada-built Forrester LRWS (Long Range Weapon System) has since been adopted by many countries as their principal sniper rifle. It is one of the bare handful of sniper rifles developed after 2040 that do not feature a bullpup configuration ('bullpup' meaning the magazine and action of the weapon are located behind the grip to reduce overall weapon length). It fires the massive 20mm HMG (Heavy Machine Gun) cartridge, fed by 5-round magazines which can weigh as much as one kilogramme apiece. The piston-retarded floating breech is equipped with an intricate gas dispersal system which decreases felt recoil to the level of an ordinary hunting rifle. This allows quick repeated shots on semi-automatic without any loss of accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"The greatest advantages of the LRWS over other modern sniper rifles are its incredibly short barrel and light weight, the only rifle in its size class that can fire the 20mm HMG round. This is made possible by a uniquely-reinforced breech and barrel made almost entirely of tungsten and titanium alloys, able to withstand the force of the round's super-high-velocity powder. Due to its short barrel, designed for tactical urban situations, the LRWS is only effective out to approximately 1 kilometre -- barely a third of the range of a standard anti-materiel rifle -- but we estimate that PHALANX should never face a situation where this might become a problem. Its reduced accuracy is amended by a highly-advanced scope that will calculate and display intelligent bullet trajectories wherever the rifle is pointing.\n"
"\n"
"The integral 'smart' bipod features a pneumatic suspension system that keeps the barrel perfectly horizontal to allow accurate fire even on broken ground. The buttstock and grip automatically mould themselves to fit any shooter. Most importantly, this rifle has racked up more alien kills in Mumbai than any other weapon deployed in the fighting.\n"
"\n"
"At half the weight of other sniper rifles and twice the manoeuvrability, the LWRS offers the power and flexibility that our agents require. This weapon will not disappoint.\n"
"\n"
"For PHALANX use, we have given this rifle the classification S-1.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Soldiers equipped with the S-1should keep their distance, fire from cover, and try to use aimed shots whenever possible. This is not an automatic weapon; a missed shot wastes time, ammunition and possibly life.\n"
"\n"
"All our snipers should carry at least one backup sidearm such as the P-12 or the CRC-8 SMG, or a combat knife at the very least. Should aliens threaten a sniper at close range, he should immediately draw his sidearm. Under no circumstances should he try to use an S-1 to fend off attackers at close range. The S-1 is too slow-firing to stop an advancing alien and will quickly deplete its magazine if this is attempted. If the soldier tries to shoot his magazine dry before drawing his sidearm, it will be too late.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"

"Descripción\n"
"\n"
"El ataque alienígena a Mumbai hizo nuestra situación dolorosamente clara. Su tecnología es mucho más avanzada que la nuestra. La completa falta de avance de las tropas de la Commonwealth en la ofensiva de Mumbai reveló debilidades críticas en el equipamiento y entrenamiento militar actual. Se perdieron tres batallones en el campo de tiro sin inflingir bajas significativas en el enemigo. PHALANX debe superar estos problemas, y para ello necesitamos la mejor tecnología que la humanidad pueda proporcionar.\n"
"\n"
"El Programa Excalibur se creó no solo para la busqueda de las armas adecuadas para combatir la amenaza alienigena, sino tambien para encontrar el blindaje y equipamiento que ayude a nuestros soldados a completar sus misiones y volver a la base sanos y salvos. Estos equipos estan diseñados para aumentar la efectividad militar de los soldados o su capacidad de supervivencia.\n"
"\n"
"El uso de blindajes en el campo de batalla nunca desapareció completamente, aun cuando se mostró ineficaz en la mayoria de los casos entre principios del siglo XVIII y finales del XX. Su uso comenzó a renacer en la Primera Guerra Mundial bajo la forma de cascos de acero para los soldados. Esta práctica continuó durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, hasta que se vio superada por la invención del Kevlar. Hoy día, sin embargo, el Kevlar ha quedado obsoleto en la mayoría de sus formas; actualmente sólo es usado por civiles y fuerzas policiales con problemas de presupuesto. Incluso los blindajes corporales más avanzados de finales del siglo XX se han mostrado completamente inutiles contra las armas actuales. Se necesitan nuevos materiales, materiales que hagan los blindajes más fuertes y a sus usuarios más resistentes que nunca durante la lucha.\n"
"\n"
"Sorprendentemente, varios informes antiguos analizados parecen confirmar que PHALANX fue responsable de algunos avances tecnológicos extraordinarios en el pasado, tecnologías que fueron despues usadas a lo largo del mundo. Cualquier intento de producir tela de araña artificial habia fallado anteriormente, pero los investigadores del Control de Operaciones del Pacifico de PHALANX lo consiguieron en 2017. Su técnica todavía se usa hoy dia, a partir de un dispositivo denominado 'telar orgánico': un enorme armazon de alimentación que puede abastecer a cientos de glandulas de seda, diseñado exclusivamente para la produccion en masa de tela de araña.\n"
"\n"
"El primer uso generalizado de blindajes militares hechas con tela de araña surgió de un esfuerzo conjunto de la OTAN en 2023, despues de que varias pruebas balísticas demostraran que las municiones usadas por el ejercito chino podían atravesar los chalecos de kevlar estandar. La armadura en sí la forma incontables capas de seda de araña tratada con polietileno molecular ultra-pesado, lo que la dota de una increible fuerza y flexibilidad. El resultado es aproximadamente 18 veces más fuerte que el acero y proporciona un rendimiento superior al kevlar en torno al 300 o 400%. Los primeros trajes fabricados de polietileno se volvieron obsoletos despues del desarrollo de la seda artificial, y las nuevas armaduras compuestas las reemplazaron rápidamente en el mundo militar. La armadura se ha ido actualizando para adaptarse a los nuevos tiempos, siendo tan efectiva que su uso es comun hoy en dia. Incluso lleva bolsillos en los que se pueden insertar placas cerámicas o de metal para proteger los organos más sensibles.\n"
"\n"
"El único inconveniento de la Armadura de Combate es su mayor peso comparado con protecciones antiguas, debido principalmente al numero de capas de seda necesarias para proteger de las armas más modernas. El peso se distribuye equilibradamente, haciendola bastante comoda de llevar y mucho menos pesada que las armaduras experimentales de nano-compuesto. Esta armadura salva vidas mientras mantiene la habilidad de movimiento del soldado.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Doctrina Recomendada\n"
"\n"
"Cuando sea posible, las tropas PHALANX deberan llevar armadura siempre que sean enviadas a una situacion de combate. La Armadura de Combate debe ser considerada la protección más básica, irrenunciable para cualquier soldado. Para algunos cuerpos especiales, la Armadura de combate seguirá siendo una alternativa comparable a armaduras más pesadas, gracias a la movilidad que proporciona. Francotiradores y cualquiera que no se encuentre en primera linea de fuego obtendrá las ventajas de su mayor libertad de movimientos.\n"

"Using a light-weight fabric woven of linked fullerene rings like nano-scale chain-mail, this armor is virtually indestructible. Physical impacts will be spread across the surrounding area, reducing the overall damage done to the wearer. Energy attacks, especially the plasma attacks recently analyzed by scientists, will be rapidly dissipated away from the point of impact and spread across the surface of the suit, then gradually radiated away. Unfortunately, in case of plasma the radiation is known to disintegrate outer layers of the fabric away.\n"
"\n"
"Battle Implications:A stronger armor offering decent protection against almost every damage kind and generally more durable than Kevlar armors. The nano-materials are very hard, but their outer layers melt easily on contact with plasma. The fullerene rings are actually lighter than Kevlar and the fabric is thinner than that of the Kevlar Vest, but the armor covers most of the soldier's body and so weights a little more. Still, even weak soldiers should be able to wear it without problems. "

"Descripcion\n"
"\n"
"La primera prioridad de la Unidad de Respues Extraterrestre es prepararse para cuando sea necesaria su presencia. La Celda para Alienígenas PHALANX es una parte importante del plan de respuesta a la invasion. Contiene celdas con atmosfera regulada, maquinaria de interrogatio, unidades de distribucion de alimentos y cualquier otro aparato necesario para mantener cualquier vida extraterrestre que podamos capturar.\n"
"\n"
"En primer lugar, las habitaciones con atmosfera regulada permiten confinar extraterrestres (EXT) durante un prolongado periodo de tiempo. Sus generadores de atmosfera son capaces de generar cualquier combinación de gases en cualquiera de las celdas, para proporciona la mezcla adecuada a un EXT en concreto durante semanas (más que suficiente para terminar cualquier proyecto de investigación sobre dicho EXT). Las posibilidades de necesitar gases que no se produzcan de manera natural en la tierra, y que esto sea un obstaculo para nuestras investigaciones, son infinitesimales. En el peor de los casos, estos generadores de atmosfera han sido diseñados para permitir la conexion de cualquier equipamiento de soporte vital recuperado del enemigo.\n"
"\n"
"En segundo lugar, disponen de maquinaria de control remoto en cada celda, que permite aplicar sedantes, mediacion o cualquier otro compuesto quimico a los EXT a traves de un aguja neumática, asi como administrar electroshocks para facilitar los interrogatorios. También cuantan con el llamado \"botón del pánico\" en cada bloque de celdas, que permite incinerar el contenido de esas celdas en caso de emergencia.\n"
"\n"
"Las celdas y los pasillos de esta estructura estan especialmente diseñados para permitir que EXT's de cualquier forma y tamaño sean introducidos y confinados. Adicionalmente, se ha dispuesto de una camara criogénica para almacenar cuerpos y muestras para su posterior análisis\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Doctrina Recomendada\n"
"\n"
"En el caso de una invasion, las Celdas para Alienígenas deberían ser usadas al máximo de su potencial, almacenando EXTs tanto vivos como muertos para permitirnos preseguir las investigaciones pertinentes. No hay mayor prioridad que la de descubrir cómo funcionan los procesos mentales de los extraterrestre en la esperanza de conocer sus motivaciones y, quizas, encontrar una forma de compromiso, una oportunidad de comunicacion, o en el peor de los casos, una estrategia de contraataque que neutralice la amenaza alienígena de una vez.\n"
"\n"
"Si una base PHALANX es atacada, se debe considerar de inmediato el uso del \"botón del pánico\" en todas las galerias de celdas. De no encontrarse en ellas ningun especimen irremplazable, la norma general sera impedir la liberación de los EXT encarcelados. Otra estrategia más arriesgada sería la de sedar a los prisioneros durante un ataque, sin embargo esta opción no se recomienda por su peligrosidad.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Para cualquier futor Comandante que revise este archivo: Ten siempre presente que la maquinaria de la Celda de Alienígenas, al igual que mucho del equipo PHALANX, todavia no ha pasado su prueba de fuego al no encontrarse la oportunidad para ello. Seguramente serán necesaras mejores y/o ajustes para cumplir las especificaciones de diseño."

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"To any noble personages reading this report -- yeah, right -- I should warn you that I'm somewhat drunk and am dictating the last of my paperwork before they close the base down forever. And I'll probably be long-dead before anyone digs up any info about this old project, so I can't get in trouble for whatever I say here. Just for the record, the bastarding SecDef can get buggered with a chainsaw. 'Budget cuts' my ass.\n"
"\n"
"Anyway, we've made some upgrades to the CC lately, so I've got to submit a new report.\n"
"\n"
"The Command Centre is the nerve centre of any PHALANX base. It coordinates all base activity from research to engineering, it gathers and interprets data from our radar installations, it serves as a war room for mission planning, and it is the C3 (Command/Control/Communications) hub that launches and directs our air-to-air interceptions. A base can still operate without a functional Command Centre, but it would be blind, deaf and dumb; our interceptors couldn't even launch for lack of traffic control.\n"
"\n"
"The CC is packed floor to ceiling with a brand new H-9000 mainframe and state-of-the-art communications gear, all of which is being ripped out by a gang of jackhammer-equipped thugs even as we speak. This equipment can't function without a power plant to supply it with enough electricity.\n"
"\n"
"In my experience, most of the command staff actually lives in the CC, but I'm told that lower-ranking individuals do get to see their bunks once every few days. Speaking for myself, though, that's anecdotal evidence at best.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the unlikely event that this type of installation is ever built again, keep it supplied with enough power to run it properly, and place it in a well-protected spot some distance from the entrance and hangars. If a base does get attacked, defending the CC should be a top priority, because without it we will be unable to put up any kind of effective fight until it can be repaired.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"The old CC blueprints have been updated by our engineers to replace the ancient H-9000 mainframe and terminals with up-to-date holo-workstations and a fresh supercomputer installation. All other components are still viable and effective."

"\n"
"By: Maj. Marcel LeClerc, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Base Entrance is the first structure built at any new PHALANX location. It is the primary -- and sometimes only -- way for equipment and personnel to enter the base. It consists of a vehicle ramp and a stairway that allow easy movement between base and surface. A small, camouflaged gatehouse is built on top for security and will also hide the entrance from flyovers. Like all our surface installations, it is coated with radar- and infrared-absorbing paints to reduce the chance of detection.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"By its very nature, the Entrance is one of the most vulnerable facilities in any base. Hostile extraterrestrials will almost certainly attempt to gain access here. It is one of the focal points for the defence of a base, and should be placed relatively close to the Command Centre so that on-duty soldiers can respond to an attack with utmost alacrity.\n"
"\n"
"On its own the Entrance facility has little tactical value. It can be assumed that any EXTs will merely try to hold the Entrance and choose more tempting targets to actually assault, since the Entrance usually contains nothing volatile and it has no areas that are particularly sensitive to destruction. Having no advanced equipment or components, it is also quick and cheap to repair. If damaged, other structures can temporarily take over the Entrance's functions without significantly impeding base operation.\n"

"By: Gen. E. Baxter, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Due to the recent restructuring of our airfleet, we've had to make a complete reassessment and redesign of our hangar facilities. The VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) requirement for all new PHALANX aircraft has eliminated our need for runways. This has allowed us to move all hangar facilities into the actual base to improve security and response times.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar provides underground space to store and maintain 1 large VTOL aircraft. Repairs, rearmament and refuelling can be carried out in complete obscurity. The aircraft never even sees the light of day until it's time for launch. During a launch, the hangar roof folds open and the large hydraulic lift raises the aircraft to a position above the roof where it can safely take off.\n"
"\n"
"For landing procedures, the lift features several tall catchhooks that -- once engaged by the undercarrige of a hovering pilot -- gently pull the aircraft down into a landing position. The catchhooks can intelligently adjust their own grip and even pass the grip from hook to hook to properly line up the undercarriage for landing. Once the catchhooks have snared the undercarriage and pulled it down to the landing surface, all the pilot needs to do is power down his engines. The system is simple and easy to use once a pilot gets the hang of it.\n"
"\n"
"A nearly-identical system has been implemented for the Small Hangar.\n"
"\n"
"The Large Hangar cannot house small craft due to incompatible support equipment such as fuel lines.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The primary function of the Large Hangar is to house dropships for rapid deployment of troops to sites of alien activity. Alternately it can house and support larger combat craft. Please refer to specific aircraft files to review their capabilities and deployment strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Every PHALANX aircraft requires 1 hangar of appropriate size for storage, maintenance and deployment.\n"
"\n"
"Hangars are a particularly vulnerable installation due to their direct connection to the surface. They will be a primary point of entrance for any extraterrestrial attackers. They are an extreme damage risk, filled with volatiles such as jet fuel and possibly high-explosive aircraft munitions. Worse, any aircraft left behind at the base will be a highly tempting target; severe damage to our interceptors -- or even more frightening, the dropship -- might put us out of action for weeks.\n"
"\n"
"If possible, all aircraft should be scrambled before an impending base attack and moved out of the area until the attack is over. They may be engaged in the air by an approaching UFO, but at least they will have the advantage of being able to manoeuvre. Still, this may not always be a viable tactic. Scrambling our craft within range of a heavily-armed attack ship could have more disastrous results than leaving them in their hangars, as tempting a target as that would make them.\n"

"By: Surgeon-Captain Helen Floydd, Medical Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"This conflict is going to be ugly, Commander. In order to treat the heavily-injured battlefield casualties we're going to see, we need advanced facilities with equipment no standard civilian or military hospital has available. This much is obvious; hundreds died needlessly in Mumbai hospitals because no proper machinery was available to treat the horrific bone-deep plasma burns inflicted by the alien weapons. We must be better prepared than that.\n"
"\n"
"The old PHALANX hospital designs are woefully inadequate to deal with the coming storm. They have never been updated since their creation in 1960 and contained little to no purpose-designed equipment. In the end we've had to completely replace them with new plans created by myself, with the help of Cdr. Navarre and our building experts. How the previous management expected to deal with battle wounds from unknown alien weaponry I will never know.\n"
"\n"
"As it stands, our hospital facilities are now the finest in the world. We are the leading experts in treating burn trauma, especially the removal and regeneration of charred tissue. We encourage injured flesh to regrow itself through intensive therapy which includes a heavy course of drugs, electrical nerve and muscle stimulation, and nanobot infusions directly into the wound. Theoretically, we should be able to restore any living human being to full health in six weeks. This includes psychological evaluation and injury counselling. Lighter injuries will of course take less time to heal.\n"
"\n"
"We also have facilities to carry out amputation and major bionic surgery. Powerful cybernetic limbs have been made available to us by our military sources around the world, as well as armoured torso cages, electronic eyes and other internal machinery. These can be installed into our soldiers at the Hospital facility to upgrade their combat efficiency if we can afford the high cost and convalescence time.\n"
"\n"
"The Hospital requires a Power Plant to fuel its high and continuous electricity demand.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base with armed-response troops should contain a Hospital for treatment. If there is no PHALANX Hospital available, soldiers will have to be sent out to standard hospitals where suboptimal treatment could result in a permanent loss of ability or even death.\n"
"\n"
"The advantages of upgrading our soldiers with mechanical parts should be obvious. These procedures can only be performed on a healthy body; convalescing troops who have sustained recent physical hardships or surgery must complete their convalescence before they can become eligible for bionic upgrades. Keep in mind also that bionic limb or eye replacement may have a negative impact on the patient's morale.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Hospital is a moderate threat area. The aliens may try to kill our wounded and deprive us of proper medical facilities, but it is relatively unlikely that any attackers would select the Hospital as their primary target. Still, if we are attacked, a guard should be posted at the Hospital immediately.\n"

"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"There is a reason why PHALANX labs have been considered the best in the US for the past 50 years. We invented aircraft Stealth technology in the 1960s with the XD4 stealth interceptor and have remained at the forefront with the first production of artificial spider silk four years ago. These are the results of combining the brightest people with the finest equipment available. By keeping ourselves at the forefront, we ensure readiness against a possible extraterrestrial threat.\n"
"\n"
"Our new laboratories are equipped for any kind of research; biotechnology, nanotechnology, high-energy lasers, particle physics and more. There is nothing that can fit inside the laboratory's walls that cannot be properly studied, dissected or disassembled. It comes standard with growing vats that can create any organic matter we might need, hologram projectors for testing and 3D simulation, laser and maser installations, a miniature tokamak fusion chamber for plasma research, and a powerful particle accelerator.\n"
"\n"
"Any one of these installations would cost a fortune for a civilian operation or military contractor, but due to our experience and efficiency, we can build and maintain all of them at a fraction of the cost. Project times are also greatly reduced by having many types of equipment available at a moment's notice. Our high-level research makes full and continuous use of all of it.\n"
"\n"
"As long as we keep receiving the funding we need, the laboratory will remain one of the most essential parts of our defence strategy. In order to defeat any enemy, we must first come to know him, perhaps even understand him. To do that we'll need the best research facilities humanity can build, and ours are it.\n"
"\n"
"The Laboratory requires a working Power Plant and Command Centre to function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Our scientists don't need a lab to live in a base, but they can't do their work without one. We should construct and operate as many labs as may be needed and/or affordable. All extraterrestrial technology must be analysed and reverse-engineered (if possible) as soon as we can.\n"
"\n"
"As laboratories go, ours are quite cost-effective to build and provide work space for up to 10 scientists each, working full-time.\n"
"\n"
"During a possible base attack, they are a moderate-priority target. If extraterrestrial attackers are aware enough of our existence to attack our bases directly, they will most certainly want to shut down our research programs. There are easier targets that can threaten the survival entire base -- especially the power plant -- but if presented as a target of opportunity, the EXTs may very well take the time to set off explosives inside the lab, which tends to be full of volatile substances. Severe damage to the base could result if our labs are not adequately protected.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Dr. Dolan Connor, 16 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Reviewing the files on PHALANX laboratory facilities, I have concluded that these blueprints were well ahead of their time. The design is still viable and can be adapted to our use with only minor equipment upgrades."

"By: Cdr. Paul Navarre, R&D: Engineering Division, PHALANX, Atlantic Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX has had trouble generating enough power to meet its needs ever since the organisation was first conceived in 1955. The old bases were forced to constantly pump in electricity from large, non-emitting sources (like hydroelectric dams) via many kilometres of wiring. They were completely dependent on outside power and were paralysed whenever the grid went down. It has taken the Russian nuclear revolution to enable full electrical autonomy for our underground bases, even when factoring high-energy research.\n"
"\n"
"Our plant of choice is the German HEFR (High-Energy Fission Reactor), a very efficient energy amplifier design. It is a subcritical reactor, a reactor that produces fission without achieving a sustained chain reaction. Instead it uses an external source of neutrons -- in this case a particle accelerator -- to stimulate the reaction. This method releases enough power to keep the particle accelerator running, as well as a power surplus that is redirected to feed the rest of the base.\n"
"\n"
"The HEFR runs on thorium rather than uranium, and most of its waste output will decay naturally to the radioactive level of coal ash in only 500 years. By comparison, the half-lives of the isotopes most frequently used in nuclear weapons and old reactors are 24,110 years for plutonium (Pu-239) and 700 million years for uranium (U-235). The short-lived waste output is particularly easy to handle for the depleted element postprocessor integrated into the design. After a full trip through the postprocessor, the HEFR's reactor waste will take only weeks to decay to human-safe levels of radioactivity.\n"
"\n"
"In our design, the reactor core and operational machinery are built into a special shell located far deeper than the rest of the base. Only the coolant tanks and control/service entrances poke up to the base level. This protects against the possible but minuscule risk of a meltdown in case we completely lose refrigeration of the core.\n"
"\n"
"I admit, I copied half of the specifics verbatim from the various briefs I've read -- nuclear physics are a touch above my head -- but I understand the stats well enough. The power output of one plant is enough to fully meet the needs of a standard base. If a base is equipped with many high-energy buildings such as laboratories, a second plant may be required, but a subsequent increase in base defences and security will be required to properly protect it. We can easily and safely store enough fuel on-site for a decade of continued operation. A protected container is installed with every reactor, and it can be refuelled if necessary.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Every base needs at least one power plant. Without a power plant, many facilities -- including the Command Centre -- can't function. Bases with exceptional power use may need two or more to keep all our facilities working at top performance.\n"
"\n"
"Our base defence strategy should pay particular attention to defending the power plant. Damage to the coolant tanks could be disastrous; if we lose too much coolant a meltdown will be hard to avoid. We may consider stepping down the reactor in anticipation of an attack, but it would take a long time to get it started up again, during which we wouldn't be able to operate any energy-intensive equipment. Things like radar, laboratory equipment, even hangar lifts.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters facility is the standard habitation unit for PHALANX personnel. It provides living space and sanitation for up to 20 people and several necessary ancillary personnel.\n"
"\n"
"The facility's lower floor contains a soldiers' barracks, communal showers, bathrooms, and a common area where troops can spend their off-duty time. Each soldier receives 1 bunk and 1 locker partition to store their personel effects such as civilian clothes. It is also intended for storage of uniforms and other on-duty equipment.\n"
"\n"
"The upper floor contains officers' quarters, generally used for any ranking/important personnel. Each private quarters has its own bed, desk, storage space and sanitary unit, and the level as a whole sports shared but separate shower cabins. This level is located above-ground and receives natural sunlight.\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an emergency, the Living Quarters has a special partition designed to function as a disaster shelter where non-combat personnel can take refuge until the all clear is given. The shelter provides oxygen and supplies for up to 12 people for 1 week. The access hatch is made of tungsten-reinforced titanium and will open for little short of a nuclear blast.\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters does not depend upon any other structures to operate.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Living Quarters are an important part of evacuation procedures in the event of a base attack. All non-combat personnel are to drop their current tasks immediately and retreat to the nearest shelter or strongpoint, be it the Command Centre, Living Quarters or other appropriate facility. Seven minutes after the attack alarm sounds, all disaster shelter doors will close -- regardless of how many personnel are accounted for -- and afterwards they will refuse to open except from the inside. Everyone who is not going to participate in the fight should be inside by that time.\n"
"\n"
"The facility is almost worthless from a tactical standpoint, and will most likely be ignored by any extraterrestrials. It is thoroughly unimportant during an attack, as well as cheap to build and easy to repair. There is very little a hostile force could do short of total destruction that can really inconvenience a Living Quarters.\n"

"Commander, we've had to make extensive changes to our old Radar facility designs to bring them up to date. The old report is no longer applicable, so I've decided to replace it with this one.\n"
"\n"
"Our Radar facility is not a large radar array in itself. It's actually a control centre for a series of camouflaged dishes placed on high ground around the base. There are between 8 and 12 dishes set up for each installation, depending on the available space and the dishes' individual coverage. Each dish is equipped with several means of detection rather than simply radar, as radar has trouble maintaining a lock on alien contacts. Supplemental systems include, but are not limited to, infrared and laser rangefinding.\n"
"\n"
"Building more than one Radar installation at a base will suitably increase the extent of our radar coverage.\n"

"The facility is manned round-the-clock in 6-hour shifts, reviewing the processed data after our computers have gathered all discernible information from a contact. Human operators are absolutely necessary and should be present to supervise at all times; what the computers might dismiss as a radar ghost can turn out to be a stealthed alien harvester ready to hit a mass off civilians. Instinct and experience count just as much as software intelligence.\n"
"\n"
"Our radar is patched directly into the UN aircraft registry and can cross-reference the transponder data of any civilian aircraft with its flight plan and cargo manifest. Non-PHALANX military aircraft are also required to log their routes into our database, but we can't know for certain if the various militaries will be very conscientious in following that directive.\n"
"\n"
"The Radar facility cannot function without a working Power Plant or a Command Centre to coordinate our radar into our tactical efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"Since our radar-emitting dishes are not located at the base site, there is no direct threat of discovery to a base from using active radar. Considering the number of other military radar sources around, it's unlikely that alien craft will be able to learn anything from a dedicated backtrace. At most they'll be able to find the general area of a base.\n"
"\n"
"However, any UFOs spotted patrolling the area may be trying to zero in on our installation, and should not be allowed to complete their mission under any circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"During an attack, the Radar facility will be at high risk. It is our eyes and ears. Without working radar coverage, we wouldn't be able to see the UFOs we're supposed to respond to. If any attacking aliens approach the facility they will almost certainly attempt to damage or destroy it with explosives. We must not let that happen.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Executive Officer Abel S. Howard, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"We should not consider the Radar facility to be an end-all solution to UFO detection. Even with supplemental systems our coverage is not fully reliable, and we should research ways to improve our detection technology if we're to have any chance of stopping the bastards."

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility is the base's repository for ammunition, weapons, and other equipment not currently in use. All small-arms, vehicle and aircraft ammunition that is not earmarked for emergency response resides in the Storage facility. It also serves as a garage for our battlefield vehicles. These remain in their bays until mission time, with fully-loaded magazines in case of a base attack.\n"
"\n"
"Cameras and alarms maintain round-the-clock vigilance to ensure no unauthorised removals are made. All removals must be approved by the officer on duty before the alarm is deactivated. Live ammunition and other sensitive equipment such as alien artifacts are kept in locked containers in the quartermaster's office behind rigorous security; checking anything out of locked storage requires the presence of the base quartermaster and written authorisation from the Command Centre.\n"
"\n"
"All item requisitions necessary for research, production and aircraft maintenance are handled by the appropriate officers; no input from the Base Commander is required. Only mission equipment and battlefield vehicles require the Commander's direct supervision.\n"
"\n"
"The Storage facility can fit a maximum of 50 standard-sized pallets of equipment. The amount of items in a pallet is relatively unimportant, size is the main restricting factor with regards to Storage facility space. The contents of each individual pallet are scrupulously tracked by magnetic labels and detailed punch-card logs.\n"
"\n"
"It does not depend upon any other base facilities to function.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"In the case of an invasion, we will need all the storage space we can get. Large stores of ammunition may need to be squared away for long periods of time. Recovered artifacts will need to be adequately contained and protected, as anything with nebulous alien capabilities should be kept in our explosion-proof lockers or be destroyed. If all the lockers are full, we may have no choice in the matter.\n"
"\n"
"During a base attack, the Storage facility would not be more than a target of opportunity. Any sensitive equipment in the facility will most likely be protected and require significant effort to destroy. Even the facility itself is cheap and easy to repair. The only threat comes from stored explosives and ammunition, which may present a risk due to the possibility of sympathetic detonation.\n"
"\n"
"Still, any extraterrestrials are unlikely to spend the time and effort getting into our explosion-proof lockers when there are easier targets nearby.\n"

"By: Gen. E. Baxter, Base Commander, PHALANX, Pacific Operations Command\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"It is painfully clear that soldiers during wartime lead highly stressful lives. In order to maintain morale they need a place to unwind and interact in a rank-free environment. We have sought to provide this kind of R&R in the form of the Team Room facility.\n"
"\n"
"It is equipped with a variety of entertainments, from sports tables to high-tech game consoles. It also features a modest wall-mounted cinema display for communal movie screenings. There are vending machines with alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and a separate sitting room for our soldiers to achieve some amount of privacy from the closeness of base living. To this end the sitting room can be locked from the inside for up to 30 minutes per day by each team member. The lock may be overridden from the Control Centre or by a present Command Centre or medical officer in case of an emergency.\n"
"\n"
"All our equipment requires maintenance, and I would argue that our soldiers require the most maintenance of all. The Team Room is one of the best ways to keep them mentally healthy and in fighting trim.\n"
"\n"
"Unless it has access to an operational Power Plant, the Team Room will be shut down to avoid non-vital power consumption.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Team Room is an important tool in maintaining good morale amongst our soldiers and should be built in any base that houses a combat team. It provides them with various vital means of stress relief, which will ease the stressful effects of continued combat, life-threatening situations, and the near-certain death of team members in the field. High morale is essential for our battlefield performance and must be maintained at all costs.\n"
"\n"
"However, I must stress that the Team Room is not a replacement for base leave. Our soldiers will still need to be allowed off-base from time to time in order to maintain their connection with the outside world and their sanity.\n"
"\n"
"For the purposes of a base attack, the Team Room is an extremely low-risk installation with little to no strategic value. If encountered by extraterrestrial attackers, it will almost certainly be bypassed altogether in favour of more sensitive installations.\n"

"\n"
"These are the finished plans for our new UFO storage hangars. They are designed to house one recovered UFO for disassembly, and will be marked as occupied until the craft has been fully broken down into its component parts and the parts transferred to base Storage. UFOs require significant disassembly before they will fit inside Storage, so they must be dismantled before we can begin to store or use the recovered parts. Doing this job on-site is highly inadvisable. It could be hazardous to the health of our scientists and engineers, it might attract looters, and it would without doubt severely compromise the safety and secrecy of our operation.\n"
"\n"
"The importance of studying captured UFOs should be more than obvious. It will give us insight into the workings and vulnerabilities of alien craft, and it may result in the discovery of new techniques to improve our own craft's effectiveness.

Salvage operations are handled by local UN forces to relieve pressure on our limited resources.\n"
"\n"
"The Small UFO Hangar can store 1 alien craft of limited size. We will assess the size of each UFO type as we encounter them and determine what hangar is required to store them.\n"

"\n"
"If this procedure is followed, the UFO Hangar will be of minor tactical importance to alien attackers and will most likely be ignored except as a target of opportunity. Preventing us from dismantling UFOs would be far less attractive than shutting down our research or production, or destroying our base outright.\n"
"\n"
"We will most likely be needing several of these installations to strip and/or examine several UFOs at a time. However, if necessary, we can remove a craft from our hangars and have it destroyed to make room for a new one. In this scenario all parts already transferred to Storage will be available, but everything not yet removed from the UFO will be destroyed with it.\n"

"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"The PHALANX Workshop is a small-scale production line equipped with the most high-tech military manufacturing processes available. It is designed for the production of classified materials and parts for which no other facility on Earth is equipped; even the replication of extraterrestrial technology.\n"
"\n"
"All parts produced by the Workshop are machined by hand with as much robotic assistance as possible. It requires the most highly-skilled engineers in the world to operate its advanced machinery, and to install new machines whenever our researchers devise a new or improved production process. The Workshop provides working space for up to 10 engineers at once.\n"
"\n"
"A Power Plant is required to keep the production line going. Without an operational plant, all production must be halted until power is restored. The Workshop also depends upon a Command Centre to coordinate construction efforts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"During a possible EXT war, we will be depending heavily on Workshop facilities to manufacture the weapons we need. H.G. Wells's War of the Worlds comes to mind for its frightening depiction of how our present technology might fare against an invasion force. Even the A-bomb may not be a sufficient deterrent. In a worst-case scenario we may be forced to resort to nuclear missiles if we have no other hope of staving off the assault.\n"
"\n"
"The Workshop is a high-security area due to its sensitive, often classified projects. The various hazardous or volatile substances used in production make it a dangerous place to be, and it will certainly be at risk during any base attack as a target of opportunity or even a moderate-risk mission objective. Shutting down our production for any length of time would be a victory for any extraterrestrial hostiles, especially if they manage to destroy a large project in progress such as the construction of a new aircraft.\n"
"\n"
"Reproducing interplanetary spacecraft technology will be one of the absolute necessities if we are ever to take the initiative against an extraterrestrial force. We cannot sit on Earth maintaining a defensive posture if we wish to put a definitive end to a military conflict. Our faithful Workshops and Laboratories are what will arm us against these nightmare scenarios.\n"

"Overview\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've been over these old files before you, and I have decided to replace them with my own assessment and conclusions about our choice of dropship. Apologies if I'm overstepping my bounds, but the old PHALANX dropships in storage are simply not up to modern spec. None of them even got out of the prototype stage when they were new. There are only two surviving examples, and both of those ships have been left mothballed in government warehouses for the past 60 years, not worth the trouble to dig out of storage. We've inherited a real mess with regards to equipment, I can't even find half the stuff that's supposed to be waiting for us. I'm doing my best to find superior alternatives for gear that just isn't up to the task.\n"
"\n"
"The one bit of good luck in this dropship mess is that I managed to persuade our UN rep to earmark some budget for a new ship, and I think you'll like it.\n"
"\n"
"The Galeoth Firebird VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) is the best aircraft we can hope to employ in our dropship role. It was designed as a cargo hauler, but has quickly been picked up and adapted into a troop transport by military contractors. It has since become a popular alternative to helicopters in both the military and civilian worlds due to its four HM-5600 pulse detonation engines, which provide the Firebird with VTOL capability and achieve good fuel-efficiency with far fewer moving parts than any helicopter engine. This increases reliability across the board and makes for a vastly faster aircraft partly due to the lack of rotor blades. The HM-5600s are still very thirsty engines, however, and the high-powered aviation fuel can be too expensive for civilian applications.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird's cruising speed is Mach 0.94. At a maximum velocity of Mach 1.03 it can just barely squeak through the sound barrier, but this causes a lot of stress on the airframe and should be avoided outside of emergencies. It has one variable weapons hardpoint located on its nose, which will mount anti-air weapons such as aircraft cannons or missile racks. It can also carry additional equipment to improve its flight characteristics and combat performance. There are acceleration harnesses for up to 8 soldiers and a cargo bay which can contain and deploy small battlefield vehicles.\n"
"\n"
"There is nothing else in the sky as well-suited to our dropship role as the Firebird. It is faster than any helicopter, more manoeuvrable than any fixed-wing aeroplane, and it can respond quickly and efficiently to threats all over the world.\n"
"\n"
"The Firebird requires 1 Large Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 1 medium weapon hardpoint located in the nose.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The dropship is what will carry our troops around the world, in order to respond to alien attacks on the ground or to clear UFO crash sites for recovery. It should be deployed immediately to sites of alien activity and to recover downed alien craft.\n"
"\n"
"Once a site has been cleared of live aliens, heavily-wounded soldiers will immediately be dispatched for medical treatment. The remaining troops will secure the area until a PHALANX recovery team can take over and ensure delivery of any and all alien artifacts to our facilities. This is important because attempted looting of items left on the battlefield may become a problem in densely-populated regions. We can't afford to lose valuable alien technology because some idiot feels the need to take a souvenir.\n"
"\n"
"While armed, a Firebird-class dropship is not able to stand up to dedicated fighters, and it should never be sent as the sole interceptor to any UFO sighting.\n"

"\n"
"The Stiletto is a single-seat air superiority fighter with VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability, allowing it to set down on tiny landing pads or in the middle of nowhere if necessary. Its huge, high-performance turbofans can turn 360 degrees for full manoeuvrability even at supersonic speeds. The giant engine intakes are protected by a sophisticated air channeling system that actively filters the air in front of the engine and redirects any piece of material large enough to harm the fan blades. They are more than powerful enough to lift the heavily-armoured fuselage and can hover unassisted for up to two hours before burning through all their fuel.\n"
"\n"
"The helicopter-like design may not look very fast, but appearances can be deceiving. The Stiletto's compact airframe can survive anything up to Mach 2 for short periods of time; it has a cruising speed of Mach 1.3 and a max velocity of 1.8 on afterburners. These high marks put the Stiletto well ahead of many military jet fighters which do not have supercruise ability.\n"
"\n"
"Once in the air, it can jump like a jackrabbit and is utterly ruthless in the hands of an experienced pilot. It can turn laterally around its hangar complex in six seconds whilst keeping its nose machine gun on the target at all times. It can flip end over end in point-three seconds and acquire missile lock on stealth aircraft before the turn is even complete.\n"
"\n"
"Missiles are fitted on hardpoints mounted just under the outer winglets. The Stiletto also has powerful Electronic Warfare capabilities, with a state-of-the-art sensor suite contained inside the nose that includes -- but is not limited to -- several targeting lasers, a sophisticated radar system, and optical imaging as powerful as any spy satellite. Small ECM emitters placed in strategic points across the fuselage will throw off missile lock and can actively jam incoming radar. The weapon hardpoints can take a variety of armaments, and the electronics are fully modular to accept upgrades. Remember, however, that space in this craft is at a premium.\n"
"\n"
"The powerful Volkot VO-36 engines consume a large amount of fuel, and the Stiletto's capacity is not large. Leaving enough fuel for interception, its maximum effective range is no greater than 2000 kilometres. However, within this radius, this craft is the master of all it surveys.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that because of its exceptional performance this craft is not recommended for use by novice pilots. Its handling at low speeds has been described by our test crews as 'tricky'.\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto requires 1 Small Hangar for storage, maintenance and deployment. It has 3 weapon hardpoints; 1 small nose mount and 2 medium wing mounts.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Recommended Doctrine\n"
"\n"
"The Stiletto is ideal for short-range interception of hostile craft that threaten PHALANX bases or nearby civilian targets. It can go toe-to-toe with anything on Earth and it will win. However, the Stiletto can't be deployed against targets more distant than 2000 kilometres from its hangar as it won't have enough fuel for both attack manoeuvres and the flight back to base. Inflight refuelling may be considered to extend the combat radius, but will require additional development.\n"
"\n"
"Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, but the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat comes for us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the human race is in trouble.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Addenda\n"
"\n"
"Addendum, Cdr. Paul Navarre, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold they held in their hands. That is, until now. What we have here is probably the most manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack helicopters to shame and can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. It does things most modern aircraft can't even dream of.\n"
"\n"
"It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially at speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech assessment. However, our pilots inform me that they can handle it. Even better, we've managed to track down a complete intact specimen, and it's in the shop right now being restored to operation. I've given the go-ahead for a full refit and flight testing, on my authority. This is simply the best knife-fighting aircraft I have ever laid eyes on. We're going to need it."

"Performance against extraterrestrial craft can't be measured, of course, but the best we can do is the best we can do. If a real alien threat comes for us in our lifetimes and the Stiletto won't do the job, then the human race is in trouble.\n"

"Addendum, Cdr. Paul Navarre, 18 March 2084:\n"
"\n"
"Commander, I've just looked at these Stiletto-class ships on paper and in person, and they have blown my mind. It's hard to believe we built these little things in 2026 -- and that no one ever realised the kind of gold they held in their hands. That is, until now. What we have here is probably the most manoeuvrable aircraft ever built; it puts attack helicopters to shame and can turn circles around state-of-the-art jets. It does things most modern aircraft can't even dream of.\n"
"\n"
"It's also a nightmare to fly due to its inherent instability, especially at speed. The original file badly underplays that part of the tech assessment. However, our pilots inform me that they can handle it. Even better, we've managed to track down a complete intact specimen, and it's in the shop right now being restored to operation. I've given the go-ahead for a full refit and flight testing, on my authority. This is simply the best knife-fighting aircraft I have ever laid eyes on. We're going to need it."

"SUB: Re: UFO -- Fighter\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Commander, my team and I have just finished another UFO report for you. Here is my summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"The Fighter craft seems to serve the role of escort to alien harvesting expeditions and similar operations. It is frequently deployed as a Harvester UFO's fighter wing, or even as a diversion to mask some other mission somewhere else.\n"
"\n"
"Though less manoeuvrable than the Scout craft, it is significantly faster, with a tougher airframe and large claw-like heat exchangers on the side to compensate for the increased power of the antimatter engines. It mounts a single weapons system under the nose of the craft. This weapon, some type of high-energy particle beam, will require thorough research before we will be able to make any conclusions about it. However, it's obvious just from our combat recordings that this weapon is extremely dangerous. It fires a beam of particles at a good fraction of the speed of light, giving it significant range before the atmosphere can slow and/or disperse the particles enough to render them harmless.\n"
"\n"
"The crew compartment is equipped with 3 duty stations. We have studied these intently and, as near as we can determine, they are designed a pilot, a gunner and an electronics officer. Like the Scout, the Fighter features no discernible communications equipment, nor does it mount landing gear. What it does have is a large targeting computer and holographic HUD to make the craft even more effective. These systems are very interesting. More research might lead us to great improvements in our own avionics.\n"
"\n"
"Our analysis has led us to some new realisations about these smaller classes of UFO. While faster than the Scout, the Fighter is still not very speedy for a craft driven by antimatter rockets. From what we've seen of the alien hull materials, the aliens could definitely build far more powerful engines with their current technology. It seems the limiting factor is fuel volatility.\n"
"\n"
"The antimatter tanks in the Fighter are only slightly larger than those in the Scout, and they are very heavily armoured; obviously the aliens aren't taking any unnecessary risks. The few tenths of a gramme of antimatter that a small UFO can safely carry seem to be just enough to complete a planet mission and return to base. If the UFO does manage to get blown up, the amount of antimatter in its tanks will not be enough to harm any other craft in the formation.\n"
"\n"
"Tactically, the Fighter is a real threat to PHALANX craft. They most often operate in pairs, a lead craft and a wingman, forming a tight, effective formation to protect larger and more vulnerable craft. However, their function is strictly limited, as they aren't equipped to do anything more than armed reconnaissance. The real threat will always be whatever the Fighters are protecting. Fighters should never be a main target unless there is nothing else left to shoot down.\n"

"\n"
"My team has analysed the remains of the arachnid machine our operatives brought back, and we have prepared a summary for your review.\n"
"\n"
"Autopsy reveals that the creature is a complex robot without any organic components. Its body is reminiscent of the terrestrial spider; a central body housing the artificial brain and power cells, and eight legs driven by powerful servomotors that allow it to move across the battlefield at frightening speeds. It is equipped with razor-sharp mandibles which can dissect human victims on the spot and store tissue or whole organs in a large cavity located in front of the power cells. These machines have been recorded cutting apart live humans during a terror mission and storing their biomass for retrieval. The process is gruesome and very, very short.\n"
"\n"
"Our soldiers have dubbed the creature 'Bloodspider', and the name has stuck.\n"
"\n"
"Ballistics testing on samples of the Bloodspider's armour plating reveal that it is very tough and has excellent insulating properties, making it effective against a wide variety of weapons.\n"
"\n"
"-- The armour is highly resistant to lasers, electricity and incendiary ammunition, but it can be penetrated by high-velocity armour-piercing rounds and plasma weapons.\n"
"\n"
"-- High explosives also achieve good results, as they tend to damage the vulnerable leg joints. This may be the most effective way to take these creatures out.\n"
"\n"
"-- Due to its robotic nature, the Bloodspider is immune to tachyon weaponry and psionics.\n"
"\n"
"The existence of this creature raises some frightening questions. It suggests that the aliens are taking a very personal interest in us, and they're not asking questions. Commander, these machines pose a dire threat to any human that comes close. If encountered, they should be destroyed immediately and at all costs.\n"
"\n"
"Sincerely,\n"

"Genetically the green skinned Ortnoks seem to be related very closely to the human race. About 80% of their DNA is identical compared to the human's. The parts that are different are most likely genetically engineered because they do not show any individual variability. The fact that they are genetically altered and that they do not seem to have any functional reproduction organs suggests that they are clones made by some as yet unknown alien species. Additionally the Ortnoks have several cybernetic implants which involve mainly the cardiovascular system, the muscles, the eyes and the brain. They enhance the physical strenght and stamnia as well as the senses to a level superior to any human. The purpose of the brain implants is mostly unclear but it is believed that they serve as receivers for commands. But currently this is only a assumption because there is no evidence proving the existence of such a master-species."

"Having the same genetic features as the regular Ortnoks, the Ortnok Warriors have beenextensively modified with cybernetic implants.

Therefore the legs and arms have been almost completelyreplaced by cybernetic prostheses which allow a physical strength far beyond the potential of ahuman being. The claw shaped hands are designed to handle extreme weights. The chest area iscovered with a thick steel plating which is almost impenetrable for regular rifle ammunition.The face mask serves as a protection against hazardous gases as well as a augmentation of theupper airways to allow a better lung function. The disadvantage of this massive cyberneticaugmentation is the increased vulnerability to electromagnetic pulses (EMP)."

"Possesses a superficially similar complement of internal organs to humans. On closer inspection the heart is found to have a more complicated structure, tighter integration with the lungs and a connection to a small, liver-like organ. Electrically stimulating the Antarean heart produces a smooth, four stroke heart beat that takes in blood, aerates the blood within the lungs, filters the aerated blood of pollutants and toxins through the additional organ, before pumping the blood around the body. This circulatory system must contribute greatly to the stamina of the species.DNA analysis of specimens of different rank reveals differences in the amount of junk DNA carried by each specimen. Specimens of a higher rank have noticeably less junk DNA, and it appears to have been replaced by DNA containing patterns that yield easily to mathematical modelling. It is possible that this species uses genetic manipulation to confer knowledge upon those who are destined to lead before they are even born.

"In the first decade of the 21st, the Middle-East was the greatest concern of nations around the world. Tensions increased when Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan formed the Middle-Eastern alliance, a political body to unite the Islamic world. Soon after, democratic elections in Iraq caused the United States to lose control of the country, and Iraq joined the Middle-Eastern Alliance along with Pakistan and Lebanon later that year. In a panic, Israel threw in its lot with the expanding European Union, thus forcing itself to abide by increasingly strict EU laws on human rights and warfare. Its military presence in the region was significantly reduced over the years as a result.\n"

"However, as 2009 turned into 2010, attentions turned away from the Middle-East as the increasingly bold power grabs by China started to make waves. The People's Republic had been nibbling away at its neighbours for several years, but in December of 2010, after decades of harsh words and grim promises, Taiwan was finally conquered by a full-scale Chinese military invasion. The UN gave several sternly-worded reprimands which were summarily ignored. The international community debated the issue at length, and did nothing.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War between the old United States and China began when China annexed North and South Korea in 2012, after secret agents managed to disable North Korea's entire nuclear arsenal for the length of the three-day invasion. The well-trained and equipped People's Army vastly outnumbered the Korean divisions; they occupied both countries long before the Koreans could even begin to receive aid from overseas. The move drew even more ire from the UN and cooled diplomatic relations between China and Russia for decades to come.\n"
"\n"
"Tensions around the world remained high during the length of the Second Cold War, with rebellions the order of the day in the newly-subjugated Chinese territories, but ultimately neither China nor the US was ready to commit to nuclear annihilation.\n"
"\n"
"The war technically came to an end in 2031, as the US economy crumbled under a crushing military budget and deficit interest rates that exceeded the country's entire gross national product. Meanwhile, having become increasingly liberal during the Cold War years, China took on the mantle of world leader without knowing quite what to do with it. Its leaders perhaps became drunk with power, a little too hungry, a little too proud. Using the army to try and enforce their decision, they attempted to revert the country to the brutal Stalinist oppression of the 20th century. The people did not approve.\n"
"\n"
"The ensuing civil war was like nothing Earth had ever seen. Officers often referred to it as the bastard child of Vietnam and the First World War. It saw firebombing of entire populations, mass executions of prisoners of war, and tactical nuclear strikes on several cities -- including Shanghai, Seoul and New Delhi -- on 7 June 2034. Government loyalists dropped a total of six 50-kiloton devices on heavily-defended rebel positions, including the civilian populations the rebels were protecting.\n"
"\n"
"The loyalist army suffered massive desertions in the days that followed; it was the single event that eventually spelled doom for the government. More than six million lives were lost before the surrender of loyalist forces on 15 August 2036, having fought tooth and nail and employed large-scale scorched earth tactics as the rebels slowly drove them into the Indian Ocean. This is the official ending of the Second Cold War."

"The Asian Republic\n"
"\n"
"In the years that followed, the reformed Republic of China -- taking up its old, pre-Communist name -- slowly relinquished its conquered territories, including those seized in centuries past, offering them a choice between independence or a seat on the new governmental council as an equal and respected part of the new Republic. Having fought on the rebel side throughout the civil war, Taiwan was the first to merge with the new Republic, reconciling its differences with the mainland after the Communist government surrendered. Taiwan quickly became a major player in the new council and was instrumental in sending the captured government leaders off to The Hague to face a war crimes tribunal. North Korea, another rebel nation, also elected to remain in the Republic, sensing opportunities for greater economic growth and freedom from dictatorship. They would not be disappointed.\n"
"\n"
"The resurgence of the Chinese economy was dubbed a miracle by contemporary historians. The first breakthroughs in nanotechnology were made by Chinese researchers, bringing in vast medical-industrial contracts from all over the world. Despite old hatreds and mistrust, other east-Asian nations slowly joined the Republic, which was soon redubbed the Asian Republic to honour its new members. Even Japan eventually joined to bolster its flagging economy and a population which had dwindled through the war years. The Republic continued mostly true to its principles with the civil war still fresh in mind. Over the years it made a reputation for dealing with all its member nations in good faith, and built enough trust and solidarity that it can now speak with a single voice for all the billions of people of south-east Asia.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Asian Republic's economy has all but recovered due to the commercialisation of nanotech and holographics. It still possesses a strong and up-to-date military, trained to a higher standard than any other country.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Revolutionary Countries\n"
"\n"
"With the successive fall of both the United States and China, Socialism in South-America waxed and waned during the post-war years. The US's economic death brought on a surge of revolutionary fervor, swaying several nations away from the influence of capitalism. However, with a democratic framework already halfway in place in most countries, the ideal of rule of the people could for the first time be realised without corruption. This new wave proposed to unite the principles of democracy with true Socialist ideals.\n"
"\n"
"The whole continent watched in horror at the nuking of Shanghai during the Second Cold War, televised all over the globe right up to the final second. The new wave suffered another major blow when China fell. In that, everyone could see a first-hand example of what might happen to the revolution if it went the way of dictatorship and totalitarianism. It didn't take long for the leaders to respond.\n"
"\n"
"Several dictator-led countries immediately tried to turn on the thumbscrews, trying to head off a rebellion before it began, which caused a huge backlash in the larger democratic nations, particularly Cuba, Brazil and Argentina. Suddenly, the last remaining kings of South-America were left with no friends at all.\n"
"\n"
"One by one, they caved to public and political pressure and were replaced by elected houses. The revolution picked up speed instead of losing it; they encouraged greater trade, closer integration, and eventually followed Europe's example of open borders. A new network of highways all over the continent strengthened economies and allowed far more efficient use of arable land. South-America's natural riches were tapped like never before, and they demanded fair prices for every bit of it.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the member nations have merged so closely that they are better known as a single body: the Revolutionary Countries. One joint government represents the entire continent, and they manage an economical juggernaut surpassed only by the Greater European Union. Their military is small but has state-of-the-art equipment. Their training is not exceptional.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"United America\n"
"\n"
"As the US economy started to break down in the late 2020s, more and more people abandoned the country for the greener pastures of Canada and, ironically, Mexico. The value of the dollar plummeted to unprecedented depths, impoverishing millions until its price was fixed by the IMF and the international banking community. The country was then saddled with a brutal reform plan, requiring it to sell off or mothball over half of its military arsenal. To cope with the repayment on sixteen trillion dollars of debt, its interest rate was frozen and its exports shifted to technology and luxury goods. Successful restructuring of NASA, combined with a functional spaceplane prototype, also turned outer space into a money-maker for the post-collapse US. Cape Canaveral began offering the cheapest space launches anywhere on the planet, first with their prototype, later with fully-functional advanced spaceplane designs. This significantly helped the beleaguered country claw its way back towards the black.\n"
"\n"
"The cooperation between North-American nations began with financial aid from Canada and Mexico, which saw their exports to the US dipping dangerously and wanted to help fix their most important trading partner. The growing number of expatriates also served to create closer ties. Then, in the most unexpected political turnaround in 2042, Mexico elected the US expatriate Esteban Villa-Lobos Garcia to the office of president.\n"
"\n"
"The election was hotly contested. However, the decision held through two recounts, and the new president was inaugurated in July of 2042. Eventually, a combination of sound policies and personal charisma brought most of the country around on Garcia; and then he proposed the Tomorrow Plan.\n"
"\n"
"Under the plan, Mexico, Canada and the USA would unite into one country to reawaken the North American superpower. In a number of controversial public votes, the general population in all three countries gave majority support for the Tomorrow Plan; 52% in the United States, 64% in Canada, and 71% in Mexico. The merger was eventually finalised in 2050, creating a United America out of the dominant powers of the New World. The booming space industry quickly spread throughout the new country, and despite a few stumbles along the way, North America steamed headlong towards recovery.\n"
"\n"
"Today, UA's debt has decreased from sixteen trillion to two, and standards of living have nearly recovered to what they were before the crash. UA has the most advanced space industry on the planet; NASA performs almost 70% of commercial space launches around the globe. It exports vast quantities of goods to every other nation and is projected to return to solvency in less than three years. Militarily, the UA is the weakest of all the meganations. It has only a small volunteer army and a tiny defence budget as mandated by the IMF. However, what forces the UA does have are highly-trained and can turn on a dime, able to reach any place in the country within two hours.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Greater European Union\n"
"\n"
"Slowly but surely, the European Union has expanded borders further and further with every passing decade. It first moved into the Middle-East when it accepted Israel as an associate member in 2011, and then upgraded both Israel and Turkey to full membership in 2017. Several Atlantic islands were also accepted in the same resolution, making it the single greatest EU expansion of the 21st century.\n"
"\n"
"Following Israel's controversial entrance as an associate member, the EU passed stricter laws on human rights, freedom of religion and separation of church and state. It was also the first Western superpower to officially recognise the Middle-Eastern Alliance, and fostered close relations with the Alliance -- despite United States protests -- in the hope of reducing culture clash and the ongoing threat of terrorism. For the most part, they were successful. In 2028, Greenland -- having grown strong due to immigration from the United States -- formally declared its independence from Denmark. No battles were fought; the Danish government grudgingly recognised the independence due to political pressure from other European countries. In the following months, Greenland briefly considered joining the US as a protectorate, but reconsidered when the EU offered a full membership. This, along with the defection of several US island protectorates in the Atlantic, impelled the EU to rename itself the 'Greater European Union'.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the Second Cold War, the GEU has always been on the forefront of political development. It was the only Western nation to second the Middle-Eastern Alliance's vote of no confidence on the old United Nations, after the UN's complete failure to act during the Chinese expansion and eventual civil war. The GEU also strongly supported the Alliance's efforts to create a new UN, providing fair representation to all the world's nations, and with enough teeth to live up to the principles under which it was first created.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the GEU is the strongest economical and political force in the world. However, its vast bureaucracy and large number of members -- members who don't always see eye-to-eye -- make it slow to manoeuvre in every way. Its military is large and powerful but poorly-integrated, with each individual army sticking to the language and traditions of their country. Military cooperation is difficult to achieve and requires going through huge amounts of red tape. The GEU contributes a majority of UN troops, but they are only ever used as peacekepeers. Whether or not the GEU militaries have lost their 'edge' has been a subject of hot debate in Brussels for many years, and there appears to be no decision in sight.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Middle-Eastern Alliance\n"
"\n"
"The rise of the Middle-Eastern Alliance was a surprise to everyone, including the people involved. It was designed solely to weaken Western influence in the Middle-East. The principal designers and first members -- Iran, Syria, Jordan and Afghanistan -- never meant the Alliance to last more than a decade, by which time they expected it to fragment and disband under the weight of its own differences.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War changed everything. The People's Republic of China was no longer a nearby ally against the West; it became an expanding threat with an appetite, casting hungry eyes on Nepal, chunks of India, and possibly even the sovereign states on China's western border. Pakistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan rushed into the arms of the Alliance in order to guard themselves against invasion. The Arabian subcontinent joined the Alliance not a year later, seeking to expand their political pull with the West. Without even realising it, they had formed a power block covering nearly the entire Middle-East. Their position was simply too good to allow it to crumble.\n"
"\n"
"The expanded Alliance, now recognised by the European Union, stepped onto the international stage with knife in hand. They had a stranglehold on most of the world's remaining oil supplies and the will to exploit it.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance's economic power grew as outside oil reserves dwindled. Pharmaceutical manufacturers packed up in droves and moved to the Middle-East, the only place left in the world where oil was cheap and plentiful. This, along with the many other applications of crude oil, allowed the Middle-East to survive the Russian 'nuclear revolution' and the subsequent worldwide migration to nuclear power. It continued its expansion with Egypt, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and disputed chunks of Africa around the Red Sea. The entire Red Sea region was quickly pacified when the Alliance moved in its military to assist the new African members.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the spread of prosperity has turned the Middle-East away from dogma and towards secular law and gender equality. It is still ruled by individuals -- Sultans, Emirs, Maliks, Presidents and Generals -- but their personal power is kept in check by the rest of the Alliance, rulers who do not want their colleagues stepping out of line. Political dissent is tolerated due to pressure from the EU and other nations, but even in 2084 few of the Alliance's member nations have a functioning democratic process.\n"
"\n"
"The Alliance military is large, fast and mean. It is one of the most elite and well-equipped forces in the world, and it uses more permissive rules of engagement than either United America or the Asian Republic. Their clause for 'acceptable civilian casualties' has been the source of huge amounts of criticism from across the world, but the Alliance has stubbornly maintained this clause throughout the four decades it has been in effect.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"New Africa\n"
"\n"
"Born out of violence and strife, New Africa found its unification in separation. It languished onwards for three decades into the 21st century, as it had done for far too long, with its civil wars and ethnic purges and atrocities beyond measure. That is, until several central-African nations undertook a massive project in 2039 to break the notorious diamond cartels and seize their revenue for long-term national improvement.\n"
"\n"
"It resulted in a military and economic bloodbath. The UN attempted various measures to stop the fighting but, even more toothless than ever before, it accomplished nothing. However, the league of nations was eventually joined by several others, tired of being pushed around by Western conglomerates, and after several years of bitter fighting they were successful in taking down the cartels one by one. This left them with some of the largest, most advanced diamond and gold mines in the world; it made their combined territory the largest single supplier of natural diamonds in the world. It also gave them a new sense of what they could accomplish together. The core of New Africa was born.\n"
"\n"
"All the African nations involved in the anti-cartel war, with the exception of territories loyal to the Commonwealth of Oceania and the Middle-Eastern Alliance, began to work much more closely together, taking cues from South-America in building a dependable road network to fuel trade and communication. It also allowed a much better distribution of food. Over the next thirty years, New Africa completely eliminated famine within its borders, which it changed completely to accomodate ethnicity and a desire for independence within its territories, and brought socialised public health-care to its people at near-ruinous cost. However, it also found new exports in the commercialised, sustainable growth of tropical hardwood and exotic fruit. The new cooperation made price agreements across the continent possible for the first time; like the Revolutionary Countries, New Africa forced the rest of the world to pay fairly for all goods and services.\n"
"\n"
"Today, New Africa is still the weakest of the great powers economically, but it is growing fast. It has a large, motivated standing army, but the troops are not well-equipped, armed mostly with former US antiques and even century-old Soviet equipment. They also have trouble getting to remote locations due to frequent equipment failures and the continent's difficult geography. Most of the time, the best the New Africans can do is spot UFOs as they land with one of thousands of scouts and small patrols out in the country to combat poaching and smuggling.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Russia\n"
"\n"
"Russia took decades to recover from the fall of the Soviet Union and the ravages of the Soviet system on the country's economy. It festered like an open wound for the first half of the 21st century, still trying to quash the constant rebellions in Chechnya, still trying to reform after 70 years of state domination, still trying to get back its lost position as a world superpower.\n"
"\n"
"Things finally started getting better for Russia when then-prime minister Yevgeny Karamazov granted complete independence to Chechnya in 2047. While the newly official Chechen Republic imploded in a storm of violence about who exactly should rule, Russia turned away and set itself to fixing its own problems, leaving Chechnya to itself -- and to the new and improved UN, which immediately took an interest in trying to stop the bloodshed. Unfortunately that wouldn't happen for a long time, and even then Chechnya could only return to Russia's sphere of influence, but for the first time it did so as a fully-recognised independent voice.\n"
"\n"
"Economic salvation for Russia -- especially with oil supplies from the Middle-East dwindling -- began with drilling the country's own oil in Siberia, with new techniques and equipment able to survive the harsh winter conditions, and later with the construction of a series of new nuclear power plants. Russia invested heavily in research to make the new plants smaller, safer and -- more importantly -- sustainable. This involved a switch from enriched uranium to thorium as the main nuclear fuel for all the new Russian plants, and advanced new designs based upon the 'energy amplifier', a new type of fission reactor first test-built near Rome from 2004 to 2011. Two of the new reactors even consumed plutonium from dismantled nuclear weapons and from the stored waste of older power plants.\n"
"\n"
"Then, eight years after the Chechen independence, Russia's 'nuclear revolution' really came into its own with the invention of the depleted element postprocessor, which could convert 90% of an energy amplifier's waste into radiation-free elements in weeks instead of centuries. The Russians ended the age-old energy crisis almost overnight; nuclear fission became safe, relatively clean, and global thorium supplies would see the world clear into the year 3000.\n"
"\n"
"Today, many of the ex-Soviet republics have rejoined Russia, following the example of the other great nations, eager to take advantage of the power generation and nuclear technology that are now Russia's main exports. The nuclear revolution continues even today with the gradual development and commercialisation of fusion power. Though its economy is still troubled, the country is now in better shape than it has been for centuries -- whether under the khans, the czars or the Soviets. Its military is somewhat antiquated but highly-trained, well-disciplined and professional, and it does not lack for manpower.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Oceania\n"
"\n"
"The Commonwealth of Nations, a political organisation made up of most of the countries of the old British Empire, lost a great deal of power going into the Second Cold War. First, Pakistan cut its ties to the Commonwealth when joining the Middle-Eastern Alliance. Then, as the United States crashed and burned, Britain and Canada became more and more concerned with their own parts of the world and let their participation dwindle to nothing. By 2030, they were members in name only.\n"
"\n"
"The growing power of China throughout the war caused a huge expansion in military budgets for India and Australia, budgets which their economies had trouble supporting. Then, in 2035, India became one more battlefield in the Chinese civil war. Veteran government troops easily defeated the Indian military in several short but bloody engagements and seized most of the country while the rebels pursued.\n"
"\n"
"Australia pledged a full-scale military intervention along with several South-African Commonwealth members. After weeks of brutal fighting, the Australian divisions managed to link up with Chinese rebel forces and the surviving regiments of the Indian army, and together they nearly annihilated the governmental army before the surrender in 2036.\n"
"\n"
"The cost was high. The conquered parts of India were a wasteland, the country had no government left after the nuking of New Delhi, and famines were already starting to grip the population. It began ceding worthless parts of land to other nations and gave independence to several small regions along its border. The remaining Commonwealth nations undertook the vast task of reconstructing India, though many abandoned the project and the Commonwealth in favour of the other growing superpowers.\n"
"\n"
"The reconstruction of India eventually united the Commonwealth into one great nation, taking advantage of their geographic location around the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific to charge strategic tariffs for ships passing through their waters. Commonwealth shipping, on the other hand, was free from tariffs and quickly rose to dominance in the competitive market. Later, with the breaking of the diamond cartels in Africa, the Commonwealth seized several leaderless mines inside its borders and used them to their full.\n"
"\n"
"Today, the Commonwealth of Nations is better known as the 'Commonwealth of Oceania' or just 'Oceania'. Since its inception it has accepted several non-Commonwealth countries into its midst, notably Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Indonesia, extending its control over the Oceanian waters. While it still can't compete economically with the richer nations, it has carved out its own niche, and is quite happy to go on prospering in it.\n"
"\n"
"Oceania's military consists mainly of a powerful navy. Its land army is minuscule compared to that of any nation except United America, and serves only in a defensive capacity, with average training and equipment. However, it can respond fairly quickly in emergency situations."

"\"Project PHALANX\" was first conceived by the United States Department of Defense in 1955, after years of growing concern over increased numbers of UFO sightings all across the world. The possibility of an alien invasion plagued badly on the minds of politicians already unnerved by the nuclear power of the Soviet Union. The existence of hostile extraterrestrial life in the universe seemed a very remote possibility, even moreso that these hostiles might find Earth among all the vastness of space -- but could America afford to take that chance?\n"
"\n"
"The project's proponents spent two years building support among the highest levels of power. Finally, in 1957, PHALANX received its first funding allocation. A significant chunk of the year's 'black budget' went to the construction of an advanced underground complex in the Nevada desert somewhere in the territory of Nellis Air Force Base. The complex was named \"PHALANX Pacific Operations Command\", loaded with state-of-the-art equipment, and staffed with the best and brightest to hammer out how best to combat an extraterrestrial incursion into US soil.\n"
"\n"
"The project was a rousing success in its formative years, developing ground-breaking technologies and producing working prototypes of things the world had never seen before, all for a fraction of the costs that civilian contractors would run up. Due to its very nature, PHALANX was the subject of yearly budget battles, but its R&D successes always gave the project a reason to continue even for the most hardline practicalists.\n"
"\n"
"However, the world moved on while PHALANX kept preparing for something that never happened. The Vietnam war saw a tremendous upsurge in military spending, almost none of which was allocated to PHALANX or similar projects, who saw their own budgets slashed and burned in the face of war. Despite repeated requests for more funding, the Joint Chiefs dismissed the outlandish 1950s program as 'pie-in-the-sky' spending and let it continue only because of its research efforts. Most of the remaining funding went to keep old equipment serviced and the labs running, if only barely.\n"
"\n"
"PHALANX never quite recovered after the war. They would never again have the budgets they had in the '50s; the glory years were over. They supplied some new technology used in the Gulf War, and experienced brief uptick during the opening years of the 21st century due to soaring US military budgets, but after these brief spurts of creativity the project would again fade into obscurity.\n"
"\n"
"The Second Cold War drained away the last life left in the project. Its commanders struggled to keep it going without even the money to keep their aircraft in the sky, but even the invention of artificial spider silk couldn't save them from the United States' crashing economy. The country's slide into ruin necked every 'non-essential' military program in the country, one by one, and PHALANX was finally stricken from the budget in 2027. It was five months away from its 70th anniversary. The staff was dismissed, the base dismantled, the unique equipment mothballed and thrown into storage. The project was quickly forgotten.\n"
"\n"
"Until it was rediscovered on 9 March 2084 by an old man who remembered reading about it in a dusty file in his long-demolished office.\n"
"\n"
"The horror and enormity of the events in Mumbai shocked the world. The existence of intelligent alien life in the universe was no longer a matter of faith. Not only did it exist, it had made contact in the worst way. The massacres were too large and visible for Earth's governments to keep them secret. Video evidence of the smoking, blood-stained streets aired on television sets around the world. The aliens had left no other evidence of their visit; they diligently recovered their dead and collected every scrap of dropped technology before pulling out.\n"
"\n"
"Panic spread like wildfire in the wake of the Mumbai broadcasts, and things got worse as word reached the general public about the slaughter in Bonn, Johannesburg and Bangkok. The world knew it had been visited, and now it began to realise it was under attack.\n"
"\n"
"The quest for solutions was frantic. The United Nations remained in session continuously for over a week. Plans were drawn up and burnt down with lightning speed. The world was completely defenceless against an alien invasion, both militarily and psychologically. No one had prepared for this. It was one of the forgotten doomsday scenarios that sat crumbling to dust in the back closet of some strategic planning office, unread and unheeded. Now, however, the public demanded answers that no one knew, action that no one could provide.\n"
"\n"
"The UN could agree only on a few token gestures; at the order of the Security Council, NASA evacuated International Space Stations 1 and 2, as well as the permanent colony on the moon. The entire range of planned missions to Mars was stricken from the calendar. On all the matters that counted, the UN was deadlocked. Some nations wanted to build massive orbital defences while others insisted they should be permitted to use nuclear missiles for UFO interception. Still others had even more outlandish projects to push. The situation grew worse as the days wore on, until one aging diplomat remembered the PHALANX project.\n"
"\n"
"With full access to the old US files, the UN was shocked to find plans, designs, equipment and training manuals; a fully-detailed response to an invasion scenario. They immediately decided to revive PHALANX and equip it to defend Earth from the alien threat. However, everyone who was once a part of PHALANX was either dead or dying. They were going to need a new staff.\n"
"\n"
"By unanimous vote, it was decided to keep the project as secret as possible, known only to the highest-ranking politicians and military commanders in the world. The public was comforted with smokescreens and sweet lies while a hand-picked team of operatives from all over the world struggled to resurrect PHALANX and whip it back into fighting trim. Old equipment was tracked down and recovered from gutted warehouses, crumbling manuals were dusted off, and stockpiles of weapons were reassembled for use. With the secret backing of all eight great powers, the project had funding, support and the men it needed to go to war.\n"
"\n"
"All it lacked was a leader."

The violent beginnings of the 21st century are far away now; distant memories, but not so distant that they've been forgotten.

"Conflicts have gotten rarer near the end of the century as new technology and universal health-care finally became available to the third world. Even the fires of terrorism have cooled in the wake of the Second Cold War, with its horrors and inhumanities still fresh in the minds of the people, from the old United States to the ravaged Indian subcontinent. Class struggles are ascending to the political battlefield now that every nation is guaranteed fair representation in the UN, and the global standard of living is slowly on the rise down to the most impoverished corners of the planet. Countries have solidified, stabilised around a restructured United Nations that successfully polices the world governments. Fragmented clumps of smaller nations, frightened at first by the vast power blocks accumulating around China and the European Union, have banded together into powerful political leagues of their own -- then found themselves with no neighbours they could safely fight. For the first time in the history of mankind, there is law and order across more than three quarters of the world."

Six small UFOs appear out of nowhere and come screaming down from orbit, undetected by the vast radar installations covering the skies over Mumbai, and set down in the single most densely-populated city on Earth. They offer no warning, no explanation. Twenty thousand innocent civilians and three battalions of elite troops are massacred over the course of twelve brutal hours before massed Commonwealth soldiers manage to bring the aliens' advance to a standstill. Then, as suddenly as they appeared, they retreat to their craft and vanish back into orbit, leaving only the ravaged streets of Mumbai as evidence."

Within hours, all three cities are emptied of human life. The attack is over by the time the various militaries are given permission to strike back.
