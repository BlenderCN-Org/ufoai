Blender export script:

The blender script export-md2-0.16.1.py is working fine with Blender v2.41, and will most likely also work with later versions.
Just copy it into your "scripts" directory in your blender installation or ".blender/scripts" user directory.
The script was copy/pasted from the forum thread below, but it will most likely be provided with newer versions of blender as well.

The same is true for import-md2-0.15.py, but it still is the script provided with blender 2.41 and not from the blender-forum.
