/** @todo - the updating of the per-entity list of nearest
 * lights doesn't necessarily need to be updated before
 * every frame; if the list is a few frames (or even a few seconds)
 * out of date, it would still probably look just fine.
 * Ideally, this updating could be done in the background
 * by a separate, low-priority thread that constantly looped
 * through all the entities and updated their light lists,
 * while the high-priority rendering thread just used the most
 * up to date version available.  The current version isn't really
 * thread-safe because it uses a global variable, which is needed
 * due to the way that the standard qsort() function works, but
 * this would be easy to fix if we used our own sorting algorithm,
 * which we should probably do anyway, since qsort() isn't actually
 * likely to be very efficient given that the ordering of the list
 * isn't likely to change very much between calls.  Bubble sort
 * would probably be faster on average.
 *
 * In the long run, it would probably be highly beneficial to
 * separate the rendering of the world from the updating of the
 * world.  Having a "rendering" thread that was separate from a
 * "thinking" thread (that was responsible for updating the
 * sorted light list, updating models and textures based on
 * animations or material properties, updating the state
 * of the world based on user input, etc.).  It would require
 * that care to be taken to ensure proper synchronization and
 * avoid race-conditions, but it would allow us to decouple the
 * framerate of the renderer from the speed at which we can
 * compute all the other stuff which isn't directly linked to
 * the frame-by-frame rendering process (this includes anything
 * that is supposed to change at a fixed rate of time, like
 * animations; we don't want the animation speed to be linked
 * to the framerate).
 *
 * Obviously, we would need to maintain compatibility with
 * single-core systems, but multi-core systems are becoming
 * so common that it would make sense to take advantage of
 * that extra power when it exists.  Additionally, this type
 * of threaded structure can be effective even on a single
 * processor system by allowing us to prioritize things which
 * must be done in real-time (ie. rendering) from things which
 * won't be noticable to the user if they happen a bit slower, or
 * are updated a bit less often.  */
