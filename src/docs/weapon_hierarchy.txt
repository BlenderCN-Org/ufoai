Most of this is tentative and serves as a "proposed" outline of the weapon hierarchy. Descriptions in the UFOpaedia should be longer than the ones given here. Balancing tentative, other than the vague comparisons given here. It also implies changes to the tactical combat simulator (smoke, fire, stealth, etc).
I abstract from the ammo clips that are appropriate for each weapon. Note that even Laser weapons use ammo, unlike in UFO:EU.
I abstract from alien armor.

==================================
Tier 1: Human standard equipment
==================================
Part of this tier is alread fully implemented. Equipment from this tier can be bought through the trade screen.

- Assault Rifle (implemented)
A rifle with medium accuracy that can fire with optimum accuracy over medium range.
Damage type: Projectile
Weapon class: Assault

- Pistol (implemented)
A one-handed firearm that is very accurate at medium range, and can be fired at short notice, but lacks the stopping power of the Assault Rifle. Useful for self-defense, and covering fire. A soldier may use two pistols at the same time, gaining twice the firepower at a small accuracy cost, but using the same amount of TUs as when firing a single gun.
Damage type: Projectile
Weapon class: Close

- Submachine Gun (implemented)
Rather inaccurate at medium range, but performs well at short range. Does more damage than the pistol at short range. A good weapon to take to close-quarter combat situations.
Damage type: Projectile
Weapon class: Assault

- Flame Thrower (implemented)
A weapon that shoots burning napalm from its muzzle. It has 100% accuracy, but very limited range.
Damage type: Incendiary
Weapon class: Heavy

- Shotgun (implemented)
A close-combat weapon. Its advantage over the Submachine Gun is that it does more damage per shot, making it a better weapon against armored targets. Its drawback is that it takes longer to fire it, allowing for less shots per round and a smaller action radius for the soldier when saving TUs for reaction fire.
Damage type: Projectile
Weapon class: Close

- Rocket Launcher (implemented)
The Rocket Launcher fires rocket-propelled grenades. It is capable of firing a High Explosive projectile, which damages all units in its blast radius, or an Incendiary one, which sets a part of the area alight, and all units caught in its blast radius.
Damage type: Blast or Incendiary
Weapon class: Explosive

- Sniper Rifle (implemented)
A gun that has great accuracy at long range. It takes very long to fire, and a soldier cannot typically move and fire the Sniper Rifle in one turn. Best suited for reaction fire.
Damage type: Projectile
Weapon class: Precise

- Frag Grenade (implemented)
The fragmentation grenade can be thrown by a soldier. Its explosion damages all units caught in its blast radius. The timer can be set between 0 and 9. 0 means the grenade explodes immediately after being thrown, 1 means it explodes on the start of the player's next turn, etc. Timed grenades may be picked up and thrown back.
Damage type: Blast
Weapon class: Explosive

- Knife (implemented)
Your basic knife. Can be used at very short range or can be thrown. Like Pistols, knives may be used ambidextrously.
Damage type: Projectile
Weapon class: Close

- Medikit (implemented)
A set of field medical supplies. Capable of restoring health to wounded soldiers.
Damage type: None, bypasses armor.

- Incendiary Grenade
This grenade will set alight a small area on the battlefield, and all units caught in its blast radius. It can be timed in the same way as the Frag Grenade.
Damage type: Incendiary

- Smoke Grenade
This grenade does very little damage to those caught in its blast radius, but it sets up a smoke screen that obstructs view.
Damage type: Stun
Weapon class: Explosive

- Flare
This grenade illuminates the surrounding area. Useful on night missions.
Damage type: None, no damage

- Stun Gas Grenade
This grenade expels a gas that causes those who inhale it to lose consciousness. Useful when capturing live aliens. The stun gas also tends to bypass armor that doesn't provide life support.

- Stun Rod (implemented)
Easy to handle device for stunning and capturing your enemy. The only downside is that you need to stand next to him to do so, but then it's a few times more effective then stun grenades.
The stun rod used by Phalanx soldiers is one of the most effective devices to capture your enemies alive. It not only deploys a huge electrical discharge onto the target, but also injects very powerful narcotics and drugs. The combination of the discharge and these chemicals can knock out even the biggest lifeform known to mankind and will most likely also work on most of the aliens we have encountered yet. The rod is equipped with two a roto hammer like spikes that will be driven into the target and then then deploy the before mentioned discharge and chemicals.
Weapon class: Close

- Mine
When a soldier sets this device, it becomes invisible. The mine becomes active on the next team's turn, so a soldier who sets this should move off the square the mine is deployed on. When any unit (including the friendly team's units and civilians!) steps on the mine, it explodes, damaging all units in its blast radius.
Damage type: Blast

-Incendiary Mine
Like the Mine, only this one sets a part of the area alight, and all units caught in its blast radius.
Damage type: Incendiary

- Stun Gas Mine
Like the Mine, only this one expels a gas that causes those who inhale it to lose consciousness. Useful when capturing live aliens. The stun gas also tends to bypass armor that doesn't provide life support.
Damage type: Stun

- IR Goggles (implemented)
This device allows the soldier who uses it to spot all sources of heat, such as aliens. Useful to locate aliens behind walls.

- Mine Sensor
This device allows the soldier who uses it so spot mines in a small area around himself. Once mines have been spotted this way they become visible and can be destroyed.

- Bolter Rifle (implemented)
TODO: Add description
Damage type: Blast
Weapon class: Heavy

- Grenade Launcher (implemented)
TODO: Add description
Damage type: Blast
Weapon class: Heavy

==================================
Tier 2: Human laser equipment
==================================
Some models for this tier exist.

- Laser Pistol (implemented)
A one-handed firearm that is very accurate at medium range, and can be fired at short notice. It deals limited damage, but is more accurate then the Pistol due to the lack of recoil. Like Pistols, Laser Pistols may be used ambidextrously.
Damage type: Laser

- Laser Rifle (implemented)
Like the Assault Rifle, the Laser Rifle is effective at medium range. It deals fair damage and is more accurate than the Assault Rifle due to the lack of recoil.
Damage type: Laser

- Laser Sniper Rifle
Laser Sniper Rifles are very accurate at long range. They fulfill the same role as normal Sniper Rifles, only the lack of recoil makes them even more accurate.
Damage type: Laser

- Heavy Laser
Heavy Lasers are bulky and unwieldy due to the triple Laser generators it houses. Because of its bulk, the heavy Laser is less accurate than a Laser Rifle, but it has a longer effective range. It also does a lot more damage.
Damage type: Laser

- Proximity Laser Mine
Not really a "mine", this device is nevertheless handled like one. Once set and activated, this mine will wait for any unit (including the friendly team's units and civilians!) comes close enough, and will fire a laser burst in reaction fire at that unit. The damage of the laser burst is equivalent to a Laser Pistol's, but the accuracy is almost 100%. Once it fires, the mine will become visible and can be destroyed. It will continue to operate until it is destroyed, or until its ammo runs out.
Damage type: Laser

==================================
Tier 3: Alien plasma equipment
==================================
Some models for this tier exist.

- Plasma Pistol (implemented)
The basic alien weaponry issued to Workers. It generally does more damage to an unprotected target than a normal Pistol, and is about as accurate as one. Like Pistols, Plasma Pistols may be used ambidextrously.
Damage type: Plasma

- Plasma Rifle (implemented)
Standard issue weapons for Soldier-class Antareans. It does more damage to an unprotected target than an Assault Rifle, and is about as accurate as one.
Damage type: Plasma

- Heavy Plasma (implemented)
A weapon normally used to destroy armored targets. Heavy and slow to fire, this weapon is more powerful than anything Earth-made.
Damage type: Plasma

- Plasma Mine
This device acts like a normal mine, but instead of an explosive blast it creates a ball of hot plasma in its effective radius. This radius is slightly larger than that of a standard mine.
Damage type: Plasma

- Plasma Grenade
This device acts just like a Frag Grenade, but instead of an explosive blast it creates a ball of hot plasma in its effective radius. This radius is slightly larger than that of a Frag Grenade.
Damage type: Plasma

- Plasma Blade
TODO: Add description
Damage type: Plasma

==================================
Tier 4: Alien Tachyon equipment
==================================
Some models for this tier exist.

- Tachyon Pistol (implemented)
This weapon is powered by a miniaturized version of the tachyon accelerator. Therefore the Tachyon Pistol has a lower rate of fire as well as a diminished accuracy compared to the other two tachyon weapons. The major advantage of the Tachyon Pistol is its low weight and its small dimensions which makes it a valuable sidearm.
Damage type: Tachyon

- Tachyon Rifle (implemented)
TODO: tweak the description a bit to match the tachyon tech better.
Although our engineers not fully understand the principles of altering the tachyons on a subatomic level, they were able to reproduce the tachyon accelerator technology. Apparently the tachyons are given a defined spin inside the accelerator so they are able to interact with any material. They still tend to infiltrate easily through any known armor and lose their particle energy not before a penetrating distance of about 10 cm. Therefore a soldier hit by a tachyon charge suffers only minor superficial injury but is heavily wounded in his viscera.
This rifle fires tachyon beams at medium range. They are less accurate than most Rifle weapons, but they are a lot more powerful.
Damage type: Tachyon

- Tachyon Sniper Rifle (implemented)
The Tachyon Sniper Rifle uses also the newly discovered tachyon accelerator technology, first found in a Ortnok scout spaceship. Unlike the Tachyon Rifle, this weapon has a low rate of fire because the tachyon particles are intensely charged before they are fired. This means that the shots fired by the Tachyon Sniper Rifle are more focused and hence have a greater accuracy as well as a bigger penetrating power.
Damage type: Tachyon

- Tachyon Grenade
This device acts just like a Frag Grenade, but its radius is larger than that of a Frag Grenade, and it deals much more damage.
Damage type: Blast

- Tachyon Missile Launcher
This device fires self-propelled projectiles that explode in a concentrated tachyon blast. It is much more effective than a standard Earth Missile Launcher.
Damage type: Blast

- Proximity Tachyon Mine
This device acts just like Mine, except it explodes when any unit is close enough. Its blast radius is larger than a normal Mine's, and it deals much more damage.
Damage type: Blast

==================================
Tier 5: Psionic equipment
==================================
Completely tentative.

- Psionic Amplifier
This device allows a soldier to attack a target's mind. Psionic attacks are barely affected by armor, and in addition to causing pain and panic, skilled Psionics can cause a victim to fall unconscious, or even take over a victim's mind. The Psionic Amplifier has a long range, but the victim must be visible for the attack to succeed.
Damage type: Psi

- Psionic Pulse Mine
This device acts like a proximity mine, but instead of exploding it emits a strong psionic pulse, overloading the neural pathways of any unit who is too close when it goes off. Most units will lose consciousness when caught in the blast radius. Those who retain consciousness will panic, unless their psionic resistance is unusually high. Once the mine is activated it is rendered useless.
Damage type: Psi

- Psionic Pulse Grenade
This device acts like any other grenade, but it does Psi damage in the same way the Psionic Pulse Mine does. Once used, it is reduced to so much scrap metal.
Damage type: Psi

- Psionic Linker
The Psionic Linker allows two Psionics to establish a bond with one another. Their minds temporarily join as one, and the psionic force of that mind is equal to the combined psionic force of the two minds separate. Usually, the linked mind will reside in one body, while the other is left inanimate.

==================================
Tier 6: Armor
==================================
Some armor exists already.

- Light Armor (implemented)
A light armor offering some protection from enemy fire.

- Medium Armor (implemented)
A stronger armor offering more protection.

- Power Armor
An armor that completely surrounds the soldier's body, effectively quarantining the soldier from his or her environment. The suit is internally powered to allow for full manoueverability, and provides internal life support to the soldier, rendering stun gas ineffective.

- Hover Armor
An armor like the Power Armor, but it allows the soldier to float for short periods of time. It cannot sustain flight for very long, and any soldier who ends his turn in the air will fall to the ground.

- Psi-Amp Armor
A modified Medium Armor that offers good protection against psionic attacks. It also offers a bomus to a soldier's psionic abilities.
