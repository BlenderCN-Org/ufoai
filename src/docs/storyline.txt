--------------Opening story--------------
2084. A time of relative peace has finally come to Earth. Old wars have been fought out, borders have been established, and governments have stabilized. There are now five major political powers in the world:
- The United States of America, which includes Canada, Cuba and Mexico.
- The Greater European Union, which includes Turkey and Ukrain.
- The Asian Commonwealth, spanning China, Mongolia, Japan, the Indonesian archipelago, India and the smaller Asian nations.
- The Arab Emirate, including all the countries in the middle east, including Israel.
- The African Union, a rising political and economical power spanning the entire continent of Africa and its islands.
Russia, its reclaimed vassal states and the South American nations have lost most of their influence, and have degraded into political minions.

It is during this time that the aliens invade Earth. They launch an attack on the city of Bombay, it being the most densely populated area on Earth. Hundreds of thousands of innocent citizend are killed before the aliens are finally driven off by Commonwealth forces. Nobody knows where they come from. An attempt at diplomacy is made, but is met with force. forty-eight hours after the initial attack, all five political blocks have declared a state of war. For two weeks, the armies of Earth try to fend off the alien menace, but they score precious few victories. The United Nations, in accordance with the five blocks' petition, authorizes the creation of a specialized combat unit: Phalanx.
Charged with countering the alien threat, this combat unit is funded by all five of the political powers, and draws its soldiers from the elite of their armies. Whether Phalanx is able to face up to the challenge remains to be seen...

--------------Overall metastory--------------
The aliens' homeworld is a small planet orbiting the star Antares. They have evolved in a similar fashion as humans, developing from single-celled life-forms into organisms, then into amphibians, then mammals, and eventually developing the opposing thumb. Today, their technology has entered the fusion age, where the power of starts is harnessed in devises small enough to carry around. They have also discovered a form of faster-than-light travel, though an interstellar trip still takes years, and the crew must be put in stasis for the duration.
However, for all their technological advances, the Antareans are a few hundred years ahead in terms of technological development. In terms of society, however, they are several hundred years behind. Their society resembles the feudal system during Earth's middle ages. The Antarean King is the highest authority, and all defer to his will.
The Antareans are a warlike species. They have already conquered several other worlds, enslaving the populace and, in the case of the Ortnoks, compel them to fight for their cause. Now, the Antarean warlords have set their sights on Earth. But unlike the inhabitants of their previous targets, humans turned out to be an intellectual match for the Antareans. Earth may well prove to be a tougher nut to crack than the Antarean warlords had originally thought...

--------------Rough story development--------------
The game should progress in the classic fashion, first battling lone UFO's and responding to terror attacks. As time passes the UFOs will grow more numerous and stronger. The Antareans will also start establishing bases of their own from which they launch their ships.

Milestones in research towards the Antarean thread include but need not be limited to: studying a live Antarean, a live Antarean Commander, Antarean fusion technology, Antarean FTL technology, and logs from Antarean UFOs and bases.

At the end of the game, Phalanx launches a mission to destroy the Antarean mothership, which is parked on the dark side of the moon. The mothership is destroyed, and the alien invasion is over. However, Antares will eventually notice the communications from its war fleet have stopped, and come to investigate... But for the coming twenty years, Earth has time to prepare for their arrival.
