1. "Antarean"
[decription]
Humanoid, big-eyed aliens reminiscent of the "grays" that dominated the alien canon during the late 20th century. They resemble humans both in form and basic anatomy. Like humans, they have a large brain/body ratio, which helped them evolve from their primal animal society into a technologically advanced, space-faring civilization.
[notes]
Having a sophisticated military apparatus, Antareans come in Worker, Soldier and Commander varieties. Small UFOs are manned by Workers, who gather information about Earth, survey the landscape, abduct cattle, the usual. Warship-class UFOs also have a squadron of Soldier Antareans, while the Commanders are found only on Juggernaut-class and Bulwark-class UFOs and in Antarean bases.

2. "Ortnok"
[decription]
Green-skinned grunt soldiers. Conquered by the Antareans centuries past, they are now slaves in their empire. Intellectually not much more sophisticated than Earth monkeys, the male Ortnoks are drilled from birth to be tough, relentless soldiers. The females are kept in breeding pits, ensuring the Antareans are never short of shock troops.
[notes]
Ortnoks are capable of using handheld guns, but cannot throw grenades or operate heavy weaponry.

3. "Shevaar"
[decription]
An unusual quadruped life-form best described as 'nature's tank'. While not higher than an average human, they are much wider, giving them the appearance of an unholy union between a rhinoceros and a creature normally associated only with darker science-fiction movies. They are carnivores that evolved on the Antarean's homeland. Featuring two sets of jaws, these creatures can rip the limbs off a human soldier with ease. Their thick hide makes them very tough, and for this reason, the Antareans use them as a monstrous equivalent of war dogs. While the enemy is busy trying to fend off the Shevaars, the Antarean troopers lay into them from a distance.
[notes]
At first the Shevaars can only charge an enemy and attack them in melee combat. Later on in the game, Shevaars could be equipped with armor for extra protection, and a tachyon rifle to allow for ranged attack.
A shevaar takes up 2x2 boxes.

4. "Hovernet"
[description]
These are small, floating, mechanical gunships dubbed "hovernets" by those who survived the first encounter with them. They are aptly named - they hover above the ground through unknown means, and like hornets they can be extremely dangerous. They are armed with a tachyon sniper rifle. They are extremely agile and unrelentingly quick. It appears these machines are some form of security system, deployed in case a landed or crashed UFO is attacked.
[notes]
Hovernets are remote-controlled, and only appear in landing/crash missions (for UFO's that have them on board) and alien base missions.
While hovernets display an apparent bioluminescence, they are mechanical and should be researched in an equipment lab rather than a biolab. Shooting them will destroy most of their internal systems. To capture one "alive", the human player must destroy the Antarean that controls it. This Antarean will invariably be found in a control center.

5. "Cyborg Ortnok"
[description]
The result of an extensive Antarean Ortnok-machine interface research program, these Ortnoks retain little of their original body. Limbs and internal organs have been replaced by machines, and the skull has been reinforced with a metal shell fused to the bone. Cyborg Ortnoks retain their ferocious nature, however, and are quite aggressive in combat.
[notes]
Unlike normal Ortnoks, the Cyborg Ortnok's weaponry is built into its arm modules. These modules range from tachyon rifles to grenade launchers.
