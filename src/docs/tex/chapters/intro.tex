\section{About the game and its history}

\textbf{something about the original UFO and UFO-series...}


\subsection{UFO:ufo defence - the idea}

\subsection{UFO:AI - the beginning}
The original engine development was done as an extreme modification of IDs famouse Quake 2 engine by a team around Herby (see credits in the appendix) in \textbf{????}. After \textbf{??} years people lost interest on the project while additionally Herby didn't had the as much time at his hand as in the early days.
To prevent that all the work already invested till that stage (tech demo 2) is lost he took the offer of one of the former Contributors (Mattn) to make it open source.  Since those days the source code is hosted by source forge and given to the comunity which is asked to use this chance to resurrect one of the most unique and influential games ever. After a short time it became clear that the interest in supporting the development of UFO:AI was unbroken and a bunch of volunteers found together to add their flavour and skill up to what you have in front of you nowdays.

\section{Open source / the comunity}
\textbf{This is rather to raise support and active participation than about doing ideological warfare, if you feel its too persuating, say so.}\\
This game is brought to you by the UFO:AI Development team and its countless contributors. All of them shared at least one thought: to make UFO:AI a great open source game. Besides detailed legal implications, mentioned in the following section and given in the appendix, most of all this means that every piece of code used to create this game is publicly available. Even more: you are free - even wanted - to change everything you want by yourself whenever you feel you can help making UFO:AI a better way to waste time. This might start with typos or end with complete mods or patches - it's up to you.  With UFO:AI being  an open-source development by a bunch of non profit orientated people this does also mean there is no big company in the back to pay for extensive testing,balancing or hardwarechecking. So whenever you encounter a bug, a hardware incompatibilty or any other problem it would be a nice gsture to give something back to the comunity - even a carefully filled out bugreport helps a lot. So we hope to do our little share to promote free software and build up a productive open source gaming comunity. And no matter what kind of skills you call your own, if you are a coder, 3D-moder, map-designer, even film-script writer, musician, concept-art designer (all of these made UFO:AI what it is today) be assured that there is a project out there waiting for your help - enriching the pool of open software.

\section{Story}
\subsection{Prelude}
The year is 2084. The Phalanx, a UN-supported research centre for alien encounters, that was established back in the 1950s to investigate "flying saucer" incidents, is undergoing a heavy structural change. Following a UN security report in 2027 titled "Terror from Outer Space", the Phalanx, which was a research-only organisation up to that date, received an increase in funds to establish a Special Anti-Terror Force to prepare for possible future encounters with hostile alien forces. After a decade, the paranoia which was caused by the 2027 Report diminished and the Phalanx Anti-Terror unit became increasingly subject to criticism within the UN, since it was never used in any real incident. More and more UN members regarded the Special Forces as obsolete and believed that resources were wasted. In 2078, the UN Council passed a bill to gradually disband the Phalanx Special Anti-Terror Forces in order to reduce the Phalanx to its initial status, a research-only organization. A cut in funds followed, as a result many of the advanced research facilities had to be shut down and many of the prominent scientists had to be fired.

Just a few days before a last group of rather inexperienced soldiers were about to leave, alien incidents were reported. Despite the difficulties that a shrinking organization has to face, The Phalanx declared itself ready when the UN Council called it back into full action. Under a ever-more threatening wave of alien attacks, it is now the Phalanx' turn to prove that its past UN-Support was deserved. Opinions in the UN Council are still divided and until a new bill is prepared, the UN Council will provide the Phalanx with limited funds based on a combination of monthly installments and per-mission payments. Under these circumstances, the Phalanx will have to save both the earth and its honour.

\subsection{Goal of the game}
As a consequence of the lack of knowledge about the alien threat your very immediate goal is to find out as much as possible about the invaders, their goals, methods and technical... and to save as much Innocent citizens as you can in order to prove your worth to the UN.\\
To reach this aim you will have to distribute your rare resources choosing priorities carefully, expand the effective action radius of your task force and other chellanges to your management skills. But on the other hand there waits a virtory to be achieved in every tactical mission you fight. All your management serves just one final aim. To beat the alien thread wherever you meet it. Using a wide and sophisticated tactical interface you will have to show that you are able to command your troops and outsmart an enemy who - without doubt - is far superior technologiewise.
