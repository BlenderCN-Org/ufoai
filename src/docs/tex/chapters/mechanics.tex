\subsection{Promotions}
While the actual implementation is still under heavy discussion a few comments might help to understand how it works now. Despite what one may think, the main criteria for promotions is not the missions / kills ratio but the mind skill. You simply don't want an psychopathic, thrill seeking terminator like guy as squadleader but someone who is mentally stable ;) Also, up to now, there is only one member of your squad who can be promoted; the rest are left with nothing.
Here a list of the different badges and their corresponding ranks.
