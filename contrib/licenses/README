This generates an overview about the used licenses in ufo:ai. It
is based on the information stored via svn porperties (svn:copyright,
svn:licenses and svn:source).

It runs right now (but will move to another URL sometime) on:
 http://static.ufo.ludwigf.org/html/

There are two version of the script available:
 1) a on-the-fly html generating version
 2) a version that generates static html files

1) Is newer and doesn't work
   Usage: just don't

2) Is a bit slow but works
   You need:
    * python 2.5+
    * imagemagick (or something compatible to "convert")
    * subversion / svn commandline client
   Usage: python scripts/licenses/generate.py
   Note: must be started from within svn root directory
