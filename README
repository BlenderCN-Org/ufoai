UFO:Alien Invasion Readme
=============================================================================================

Linux:
To install the game use the liflg.org-installer. This will bring you the data-files
which aren't in svn-repository, yet. After this do a
  mkdir ufoai
  cd ufoai/
  svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ufoai/ufoai/trunk .
  cd src/linux
  make
Now you have the binaries in src/linux/debugARCH or src/linux/releaseARCH - copy them over
the binaries that comes with the liflg.org-installer or symlink them.

Windows:
To install the game use the Windows-Installer at
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=157793
This includes the data-files which aren't in svn-repository, yet.

FAQ:
=============================================================================================
Q: The ufo binary can't find all the needed files
A: Make sure that you do not execute the binary in src/linux/debugARCH resp.
   src/linux/releaseARCH dir.
   You need to copy or link the files to svn-root dir:
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/ref_glx.so
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/ufo
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/ufoded
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/game.so base/
