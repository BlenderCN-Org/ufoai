UFO:Alien Invasion Readme
=============================================================================================

====================================================
General information:
====================================================
All data files are in the svn repository. But you have to keep some things in mind.
There are only the source-map-files. Quake2 based games need to compile them. We have included
a compile.pl (Perl-scriptfile) in base/maps (you need the programming language Perl installed).
For Windows you can use Active State Perl. For linux you should already have Perl installed.

You can also run make in the base/maps folder to compile the maps - this has several advantages
over the compile.pl method:
+ just recompile changes maps (e.g. after a svn update)
+ use more then one cpu
But you need GNU make installed to do this (comes with e.g. Dev-CPP - see below)

In both cases you need the quake map compile tools (found on sf.net or in src/tools - see below)
named qbsp3 and qrad3.


====================================================
Linux:
====================================================

o Grab SVN
====================================================
Grab the svn-revision (version controll system) with the command:
svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ufoai/ufoai/trunk .

o  Installation of header files to compile the game
====================================================
You need to install development files for some libraries to compile
UFO:Alien Invasion (these are the Debian package names):
libjpeg62-dev
libogg-dev
libvorbis-dev
libsdl1.2-dev
libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

others:
OpenGL-headers (normally comes with OpenGL-drivers)
X-headers

o Compile SVN
====================================================
(Of course you need to have gcc installed)
Follow these steps:
  cd src/linux
  make
  cd ../tools
  make

o Compile Maps
====================================================
To compile the maps with qbsp3 and qrad3 type:
  cd base/maps
  make

o  Installation of additional libraries (if not found on game-start):
====================================================
You have to have installed the following libs
SDL Runtime Libraries, JPEG library, Gettext (some distributions have linked this into
there standard c lib), OGG library
Install them via your distribution package manager

o Run the game
====================================================
Now you have the binaries in src/linux/debugARCH or src/linux/releaseARCH - copy them over
or symlink them (description in FAQ) to the appropriate places.
After this you have to edit the default.cfg in base-folder - change vid_ref and gl_driver to
the Linux values.


====================================================
Windows:
====================================================

o Grab SVN
====================================================
For Windows you can use e.g. TortoiseSVN (http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/) and follow the steps
on http://ufoai.sourceforge.net/tutorials/svn.html

o  Compile with Visual Studio Express
====================================================
To compile the game you need to download the express edition of MS Visual Studio.
In the current svn-repository there are project files for Visual Studio.

o  Compile with Dev-CPP
====================================================
Use the Dev-CPP webupdate feature or when installation of additional packages
from Dev-CPP webupdate doesn't work for you (proxy etc...):
Tools -> Package Manager -> Install -> select .DevPak file

You can find the devpaks at:
http://devpaks.org/
or
http://old.devpaks.org/

Package: SDL Library
Package: SDL_ttf Library
Package: Ogg Vorbis SDK
Package: libjpeg 6b-4
Package: libintl (gettext)

DirectX is used for sound - if you don't want to use DirectX but SDL you have to set
the compiler-option -DUSE_SDL_SOUND in project options of ufo.dev

o Compile Maps
====================================================
+ install Active State Perl and type perl compile.pl in base/maps
+ or install GNU make (or Dev-CPP - there it is included) and type make in base/maps
  (when make is in the PATH environment var - otherwise you need to enter the full path to make)

o  Installation of additional libraries (if not found on game-start):
====================================================
Search the inet for following files (these will be included in every official release)
Library: SDL Runtime Libraries (SDL.dll, SDL_ttf.dll)
Library: JPEG library (jpeg62.dll)
Library: Gettext (libintl.dll, libiconv.dll)


====================================================
MacOSX:
====================================================
Currently the game does not run on MacOSX - we are searching help with porting.
There is already a port of the quake2-engine available which can be adopted
(http://www.fruitz-of-dojo.de).


====================================================
PlayStation Portable:
====================================================
There is also a port for PSP in work (http://teamemergencyexit.com/quake2). Maybe
we even get UFO:AI to PSP. Feel free to contribute.



====================================================
FAQ:
=============================================================================================
Q: The ufo binary can't find all the needed files
A: Make sure that you do not execute the binary in src/linux/debugARCH resp.
   src/linux/releaseARCH dir.
   You need to copy or link the files to svn-root dir:
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/ref_glx.so
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/ufo
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/ufoded
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/game.so base/

   It's the same for other architectures, too. E.g. for AMD64 it is debugx86_64
--------
Q: I have problems with building and/or running the game
A: Have a look at http://ufoai.sourceforge.net/tutorials.html
   there you can find a few tutorials which may help you.
   You can also ask your question at channel #ufo:ai at irc.freenode.org
   or at the mailinglist http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=157793
   Last but not least you can join the forums at http://www.ufoai.net to get
   help
