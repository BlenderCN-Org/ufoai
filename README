UFO:Alien Invasion Readme
=============================================================================================

Linux:
====================================================
Follow these steps:
  mkdir ufoai
  cd ufoai/
  svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ufoai/ufoai/trunk .
  cd src/linux
  make
Now you have the binaries in src/linux/debugARCH or src/linux/releaseARCH - copy them over
or symlink them (description in FAQ) to the appropriate places.
After this you have to edit the default.cfg in base-folder - change vid_ref and gl_driver to
the Linux values.

Windows:
====================================================
To install the game use the Windows-Installer at
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=157793

To compile the game download the express edition of MS Visual Studio.
Download the svn (see http://ufoai.sf.net/tutorials.html for svn-help) and open
the project files from repository.

MacOSX:
====================================================
Currently the game does not run on MacOSX - we are searching help with porting.
There is already a port of the quake2-engine available which can be adopted
(http://www.fruitz-of-dojo.de).

PlayStation Portable:
====================================================
There is also a port for PSP in work (http://teamemergencyexit.com/quake2). Maybe
we even get UFO:AI to PSP. Feel free to contribute.


FAQ:
=============================================================================================
Q: The ufo binary can't find all the needed files
A: Make sure that you do not execute the binary in src/linux/debugARCH resp.
   src/linux/releaseARCH dir.
   You need to copy or link the files to svn-root dir:
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/ref_glx.so
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/ufo
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/ufoded
   ln -s src/linux/debugi386/game.so base/

   It's the same for other architectures, too. E.g. for AMD64 it is debugx86_64
--------
Q: I have problems with building and/or running the game
A: Have a look at http://ufoai.sourceforge.net/tutorials.html
   there you can find a few tutorials which may help you.
   You can also ask your question at channel #ufo:ai at irc.freenode.org
   or at the mailinglist http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=157793
