tip "_Use the [Shift] key to align your targeting height - useful to shoot a rocketlauncher in front of an alien group, for example."

tip "_Assemble and save different teams for multiplayer matches - 4 player teams, 8 player teams and so on. This way you can quickly load the right one for a fast match."

tip "_You can make soldiers crouch to better protect them from enemy fire. But remember that crouching and standing up cost Time Units (TUs), and moving while crouched costs more TUs than walking normally."

tip "_You can increase a base's radar range by building an advanced radar facility. Remember that you have to research it first!"
tip "_Air Burst from the Grenade Launcher lets you explode those grenades in a specific place. Very useful when targetting something near the edge of the map, or on a ledge."
tip "_When throwing grenades, try to avoid straight throws along the grid. With at least a little bit of an angle, the chances of bouncing it back at yourself becomes much less on a 'missed' throw."
tip "_Before throwing a grenade, look closely at the shape of the land. A slight slope will affect the direction that the grenade bounces."

tip "_To quickly buy or sell items, hover over the arrows and roll your mousewheel."
tip "_Beware of friendly fire! While lobbing a grenade at an enemy who snuck up on your troops might be an easy kill, chances are you'll do the aliens' work for them. The same can be said about bullets, make sure once the enemy is dead you wont be shooting your own troops behind him."
tip "_Remember to check your research and production queues often! A good arsenal is an active arsenal!"
tip "_The presence of live civilians probably means that there are no live aliens nearby. This can save time clearing a map."
tip "_Watch the health of your soldiers; do not let them die. Experienced soldiers are more efficient in missions than new recruits."
