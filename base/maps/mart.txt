"Supermarket" Version 1.0 (Released 2/20/05) - a map for UFO:AI by Drew Babkirk (Druterium)

1. Make sure to back up your campaign.ufo and campaign.hard files before unzipping!

2. Unzip to your main UFO:AI directory.

3. After this, simply go into the game and start a new game. My map will be the first one in the campaign now! 

Please send all feedback to druterium@yahoo.com or post it on the forums!
